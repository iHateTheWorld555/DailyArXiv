| **[V-RGBX: Video Editing with Accurate Controls over Intrinsic Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11799v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale video generation models have shown remarkable potential in modeling photorealistic appearance and lighting interactions in real-world scenes. However, a closed-loop framework that jointly understands intrinsic scene properties (e.g., albedo, normal, material, and irradiance), leverages them for video synthesis, and supports editable intrinsic representations remains unexplored. We present V-RGBX, the first end-to-end framework for intrinsic-aware video editing. V-RGBX unifies three key capabilities: (1) video inverse rendering into intrinsic channels, (2) photorealistic video synthesis from these intrinsic representations, and (3) keyframe-based video editing conditioned on intrinsic channels. At the core of V-RGBX is an interleaved conditioning mechanism that enables intuitive, physically grounded video editing through user-selected keyframes, supporting flexible manipulation of any intrinsic modality. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that V-RGBX produces temporally consistent, photorealistic videos while propagating keyframe edits across sequences in a physically plausible manner. We demonstrate its effectiveness in diverse applications, including object appearance editing and scene-level relighting, surpassing the performance of prior methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://aleafy.github.io/vrgbx</p></details> |
| **[Particulate: Feed-Forward 3D Object Articulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11798v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Particulate, a feed-forward approach that, given a single static 3D mesh of an everyday object, directly infers all attributes of the underlying articulated structure, including its 3D parts, kinematic structure, and motion constraints. At its core is a transformer network, Part Articulation Transformer, which processes a point cloud of the input mesh using a flexible and scalable architecture to predict all the aforementioned attributes with native multi-joint support. We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences. Quantitative and qualitative results show that Particulate significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ruiningli.com/particulate</p></details> |
| **[AnchorDream: Repurposing Video Diffusion for Embodiment-Aware Robot Data Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11797v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The collection of large-scale and diverse robot demonstrations remains a major bottleneck for imitation learning, as real-world data acquisition is costly and simulators offer limited diversity and fidelity with pronounced sim-to-real gaps. While generative models present an attractive solution, existing methods often alter only visual appearances without creating new behaviors, or suffer from embodiment inconsistencies that yield implausible motions. To address these limitations, we introduce AnchorDream, an embodiment-aware world model that repurposes pretrained video diffusion models for robot data synthesis. AnchorDream conditions the diffusion process on robot motion renderings, anchoring the embodiment to prevent hallucination while synthesizing objects and environments consistent with the robot's kinematics. Starting from only a handful of human teleoperation demonstrations, our method scales them into large, diverse, high-quality datasets without requiring explicit environment modeling. Experiments show that the generated data leads to consistent improvements in downstream policy learning, with relative gains of 36.4% in simulator benchmarks and nearly double performance in real-world studies. These results suggest that grounding generative world models in robot motion provides a practical path toward scaling imitation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://jay-ye.github.io/AnchorDream/</p></details> |
| **[Structure From Tracking: Distilling Structure-Preserving Motion for Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11792v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reality is a dance between rigid constraints and deformable structures. For video models, that means generating motion that preserves fidelity as well as structure. Despite progress in diffusion models, producing realistic structure-preserving motion remains challenging, especially for articulated and deformable objects such as humans and animals. Scaling training data alone, so far, has failed to resolve physically implausible transitions. Existing approaches rely on conditioning with noisy motion representations, such as optical flow or skeletons extracted using an external imperfect model. To address these challenges, we introduce an algorithm to distill structure-preserving motion priors from an autoregressive video tracking model (SAM2) into a bidirectional video diffusion model (CogVideoX). With our method, we train SAM2VideoX, which contains two innovations: (1) a bidirectional feature fusion module that extracts global structure-preserving motion priors from a recurrent model like SAM2; (2) a Local Gram Flow loss that aligns how local features move together. Experiments on VBench and in human studies show that SAM2VideoX delivers consistent gains (+2.60\% on VBench, 21-22\% lower FVD, and 71.4\% human preference) over prior baselines. Specifically, on VBench, we achieve 95.51\%, surpassing REPA (92.91\%) by 2.60\%, and reduce FVD to 360.57, a 21.20\% and 22.46\% improvement over REPA- and LoRA-finetuning, respectively.

| **[Toward a Decision Support System for Energy-Efficient Ferry Operation on Lake Constance based on Optimal Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11786v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The maritime sector is undergoing a disruptive technological change driven by three main factors: autonomy, decarbonization, and digital transformation. Addressing these factors necessitates a reassessment of inland vessel operations. This paper presents the design and development of a decision support system for ferry operations based on a shrinking-horizon optimal control framework. The problem formulation incorporates a mathematical model of the ferry's dynamics and environmental disturbances, specifically water currents and wind, which can significantly influence the dynamics. Real-world data and illustrative scenarios demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to effectively support ferry crews by providing real-time guidance. This enables enhanced operational efficiency while maintaining predefined maneuver durations. The findings suggest that optimal control applications hold substantial promise for advancing future ferry operations on inland waters.

| **[Universal entrywise eigenvector fluctuations in delocalized spiked matrix models and asymptotics of rounded spectral algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11785v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the distribution of the top eigenvector $\widehat{v}$ of a spiked matrix model of the form $H = θvv^* + W$, in the supercritical regime where $H$ has an outlier eigenvalue of comparable magnitude to $\|W\|$. We show that, if $v$ is sufficiently delocalized, then the distribution of the individual entries of $\widehat{v}$ (not, we emphasize, merely the inner product $\langle \widehat{v}, v\rangle$) is universal over a large class of generalized Wigner matrices $W$ having independent entries, depending only on the first two moments of the distributions of the entries of $W$. This complements the observation of Capitaine and Donati-Martin (2018) that these distributions are not universal when $v$ is instead sufficiently localized. Further, for $W$ having entrywise variances close to constant and thus resembling a Wigner matrix, we show by comparing to the case of $W$ drawn from the Gaussian orthogonal or unitary ensembles that averages of entrywise functions of $\widehat{v}$ behave as they would if $\widehat{v}$ had Gaussian fluctuations around a suitable multiple of $v$. We apply these results to study spectral algorithms followed by rounding procedures in dense stochastic block models and synchronization problems over the cyclic and circle groups, obtaining the first precise asymptotic characterizations of the error rates of such algorithms.</p></details> | 47 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Super Suffixes: Bypassing Text Generation Alignment and Guard Models Simultaneously](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11783v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) has created an urgent need for enhanced security and privacy measures in Machine Learning (ML). LLMs are increasingly being used to process untrusted text inputs and even generate executable code, often while having access to sensitive system controls. To address these security concerns, several companies have introduced guard models, which are smaller, specialized models designed to protect text generation models from adversarial or malicious inputs. In this work, we advance the study of adversarial inputs by introducing Super Suffixes, suffixes capable of overriding multiple alignment objectives across various models with different tokenization schemes. We demonstrate their effectiveness, along with our joint optimization technique, by successfully bypassing the protection mechanisms of Llama Prompt Guard 2 on five different text generation models for malicious text and code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to reveal that Llama Prompt Guard 2 can be compromised through joint optimization. Additionally, by analyzing the changing similarity of a model's internal state to specific concept directions during token sequence processing, we propose an effective and lightweight method to detect Super Suffix attacks. We show that the cosine similarity between the residual stream and certain concept directions serves as a distinctive fingerprint of model intent. Our proposed countermeasure, DeltaGuard, significantly improves the detection of malicious prompts generated through Super Suffixes. It increases the non-benign classification rate to nearly 100%, making DeltaGuard a valuable addition to the guard model stack and enhancing robustness against adversarial prompt attacks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 Figures |
| **[MatAnyone 2: Scaling Video Matting via a Learned Quality Evaluator](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11782v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Video matting remains limited by the scale and realism of existing datasets. While leveraging segmentation data can enhance semantic stability, the lack of effective boundary supervision often leads to segmentation-like mattes lacking fine details. To this end, we introduce a learned Matting Quality Evaluator (MQE) that assesses semantic and boundary quality of alpha mattes without ground truth. It produces a pixel-wise evaluation map that identifies reliable and erroneous regions, enabling fine-grained quality assessment. The MQE scales up video matting in two ways: (1) as an online matting-quality feedback during training to suppress erroneous regions, providing comprehensive supervision, and (2) as an offline selection module for data curation, improving annotation quality by combining the strengths of leading video and image matting models. This process allows us to build a large-scale real-world video matting dataset, VMReal, containing 28K clips and 2.4M frames. To handle large appearance variations in long videos, we introduce a reference-frame training strategy that incorporates long-range frames beyond the local window for effective training. Our MatAnyone 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world benchmarks, surpassing prior methods across all metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://pq-yang.github.io/projects/MatAnyone2/</p></details> |
| **[How Muon's Spectral Design Benefits Generalization: A Study on Imbalanced Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22980v3)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of spectrum-aware matrix-valued optimizers such as Muon and Shampoo in deep learning motivates a systematic study of their generalization properties and, in particular, when they might outperform competitive algorithms. We approach this question by introducing appropriate simplifying abstractions as follows: First, we use imbalanced data as a testbed. Second, we study the canonical form of such optimizers, which is Spectral Gradient Descent (SpecGD) -- each update step is $UV^T$ where $UΣV^T$ is the truncated SVD of the gradient. Third, within this framework we identify a canonical setting for which we precisely quantify when SpecGD outperforms vanilla Euclidean GD. For a Gaussian mixture data model and both linear and bilinear models, we show that unlike GD, which prioritizes learning dominant principal components of the data first, SpecGD learns all principal components of the data at equal rates. We demonstrate how this translates to a growing gap in class balanced loss favoring SpecGD early in training and further show that the gap remains consistent even when the GD counterpart uses adaptive step-sizes via normalization. By extending the analysis to deep linear models, we show that depth amplifies these effects. We empirically verify our theoretical findings on a variety of imbalanced datasets. Our experiments compare practical variants of spectral methods, like Muon and Shampoo, against their Euclidean counterparts and Adam. The results validate our findings that these spectral optimizers achieve superior generalization by promoting a more balanced learning of the data's underlying components.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 32 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[ProbeMDE: Uncertainty-Guided Active Proprioception for Monocular Depth Estimation in Surgical Robotics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11773v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monocular depth estimation (MDE) provides a useful tool for robotic perception, but its predictions are often uncertain and inaccurate in challenging environments such as surgical scenes where textureless surfaces, specular reflections, and occlusions are common. To address this, we propose ProbeMDE, a cost-aware active sensing framework that combines RGB images with sparse proprioceptive measurements for MDE. Our approach utilizes an ensemble of MDE models to predict dense depth maps conditioned on both RGB images and on a sparse set of known depth measurements obtained via proprioception, where the robot has touched the environment in a known configuration. We quantify predictive uncertainty via the ensemble's variance and measure the gradient of the uncertainty with respect to candidate measurement locations. To prevent mode collapse while selecting maximally informative locations to propriocept (touch), we leverage Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) over this gradient map. We validate our method in both simulated and physical experiments on central airway obstruction surgical phantoms. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline methods across standard depth estimation metrics, achieving higher accuracy while minimizing the number of required proprioceptive measurements.</p></details> | 9 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Smudged Fingerprints: A Systematic Evaluation of the Robustness of AI Image Fingerprints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11771v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model fingerprint detection techniques have emerged as a promising approach for attributing AI-generated images to their source models, but their robustness under adversarial conditions remains largely unexplored. We present the first systematic security evaluation of these techniques, formalizing threat models that encompass both white- and black-box access and two attack goals: fingerprint removal, which erases identifying traces to evade attribution, and fingerprint forgery, which seeks to cause misattribution to a target model. We implement five attack strategies and evaluate 14 representative fingerprinting methods across RGB, frequency, and learned-feature domains on 12 state-of-the-art image generators. Our experiments reveal a pronounced gap between clean and adversarial performance. Removal attacks are highly effective, often achieving success rates above 80% in white-box settings and over 50% under constrained black-box access. While forgery is more challenging than removal, its success significantly varies across targeted models. We also identify a utility-robustness trade-off: methods with the highest attribution accuracy are often vulnerable to attacks. Although some techniques exhibit robustness in specific settings, none achieves high robustness and accuracy across all evaluated threat models. These findings highlight the need for techniques balancing robustness and accuracy, and identify the most promising approaches for advancing this goal.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in the 4th IEEE Conference on Secure and Trustworthy Machine Learning (IEEE SaTML 2026).

We present BLURR, a lightweight inference wrapper that can be plugged into existing VLA controllers without retraining or changing model checkpoints. Instantiated on the pi-zero VLA controller, BLURR keeps the original observation interfaces and accelerates control by combining an instruction prefix key value cache, mixed precision execution, and a single step rollout schedule that reduces per step computation. In our SimplerEnv based evaluation, BLURR maintains task success rates comparable to the original controller while significantly lowering effective FLOPs and wall clock latency. We also build an interactive web demo that allows users to switch between controllers and toggle inference options in real time while watching manipulation episodes. This highlights BLURR as a practical approach for deploying modern VLA policies under tight compute budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures.

| **[A Family of LZ78-based Universal Sequential Probability Assignments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06589v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose and study a family of universal sequential probability assignments on individual sequences, based on the incremental parsing procedure of the Lempel-Ziv (LZ78) compression algorithm. We show that the normalized log loss under any of these models converges to the normalized LZ78 codelength, uniformly over all individual sequences. To establish the universality of these models, we consolidate a set of results from the literature relating finite-state compressibility to optimal log-loss under Markovian and finite-state models. We also consider some theoretical and computational properties of these models when viewed as probabilistic sources. Finally, we present experimental results showcasing the potential benefit of using this family -- as models and as sources -- for compression, generation, and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 5 figures, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |
| **[Reducing Domain Gap with Diffusion-Based Domain Adaptation for Cell Counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11763v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating realistic synthetic microscopy images is critical for training deep learning models in label-scarce environments, such as cell counting with many cells per image. However, traditional domain adaptation methods often struggle to bridge the domain gap when synthetic images lack the complex textures and visual patterns of real samples. In this work, we adapt the Inversion-Based Style Transfer (InST) framework originally designed for artistic style transfer to biomedical microscopy images. Our method combines latent-space Adaptive Instance Normalization with stochastic inversion in a diffusion model to transfer the style from real fluorescence microscopy images to synthetic ones, while weakly preserving content structure. We evaluate the effectiveness of our InST-based synthetic dataset for downstream cell counting by pre-training and fine-tuning EfficientNet-B0 models on various data sources, including real data, hard-coded synthetic data, and the public Cell200-s dataset. Models trained with our InST-synthesized images achieve up to 37\% lower Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to models trained on hard-coded synthetic data, and a 52\% reduction in MAE compared to models trained on Cell200-s (from 53.70 to 25.95 MAE). Notably, our approach also outperforms models trained on real data alone (25.95 vs. 27.74 MAE). Further improvements are achieved when combining InST-synthesized data with lightweight domain adaptation techniques such as DACS with CutMix. These findings demonstrate that InST-based style transfer most effectively reduces the domain gap between synthetic and real microscopy data. Our approach offers a scalable path for enhancing cell counting performance while minimizing manual labeling effort.

| **[REDELEX: A Framework for Relational Deep Learning Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22199v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Relational databases (RDBs) are widely regarded as the gold standard for storing structured information. Consequently, predictive tasks leveraging this data format hold significant application promise. Recently, Relational Deep Learning (RDL) has emerged as a novel paradigm wherein RDBs are conceptualized as graph structures, enabling the application of various graph neural architectures to effectively address these tasks. However, given its novelty, there is a lack of analysis into the relationships between the performance of various RDL models and the characteristics of the underlying RDBs. In this study, we present REDELEX$-$a comprehensive exploration framework for evaluating RDL models of varying complexity on the most diverse collection of over 70 RDBs, which we make available to the community. Benchmarked alongside key representatives of classic methods, we confirm the generally superior performance of RDL while providing insights into the main factors shaping performance, including model complexity, database sizes and their structural properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ECMLPKDD 2025 at Porto, Portugal</p></details> |

Existing LLM-based summarizers remain generic and fail to account for individual preferences, limiting their practical utility. We propose SUMFORU, a steerable review summarization framework that aligns outputs with explicit user personas to support personalized purchase decisions. Our approach integrates a high-quality data pipeline built from the Amazon 2023 Review Dataset with a two-stage alignment procedure: (1) persona-aware Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) via asymmetric knowledge distillation, and (2) Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback (RLAIF) using a preference estimator to capture fine-grained, persona-relevant signals. We evaluate the model across rule-based, LLM-based, and human-centered metrics, demonstrating consistent improvements in consistency, grounding, and preference alignment. Our framework achieves the highest performance across all evaluation settings and generalizes effectively to unseen product categories. Our results highlight the promise of steerable pluralistic alignment for building next-generation personalized decision-support systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/Harry20030331/SumForU</p></details> |
| **[MTTR-A: Measuring Cognitive Recovery Latency in Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20663v3)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring cognitive stability in autonomous multi-agent systems (MAS) is a central challenge for large-scale, distributed AI. While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair. A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies. By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance</p></details> | preprint |
| **[LUCID: Learning-Enabled Uncertainty-Aware Certification of Stochastic Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11750v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of AI-enabled systems, particularly in high-stakes domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare, has become increasingly critical. Traditional formal verification tools fall short when faced with systems that embed both opaque, black-box AI components and complex stochastic dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce LUCID (Learning-enabled Uncertainty-aware Certification of stochastIc Dynamical systems), a verification engine for certifying safety of black-box stochastic dynamical systems from a finite dataset of random state transitions. As such, LUCID is the first known tool capable of establishing quantified safety guarantees for such systems. Thanks to its modular architecture and extensive documentation, LUCID is designed for easy extensibility. LUCID employs a data-driven methodology rooted in control barrier certificates, which are learned directly from system transition data, to ensure formal safety guarantees. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where an RKHS ambiguity set is constructed that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. A key innovation within LUCID is its use of a finite Fourier kernel expansion to reformulate a semi-infinite non-convex optimization problem into a tractable linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. LUCID thus offers a robust and efficient verification framework, able to handle the complexities of modern black-box systems while providing formal guarantees of safety. These unique capabilities are demonstrated on challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted for publication in the main track of AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Despite this potential, training large-scale text-to-image diffusion models entirely within the VFM representation space remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we scale the SVG (Self-supervised representations for Visual Generation) framework, proposing SVG-T2I to support high-quality text-to-image synthesis directly in the VFM feature domain. By leveraging a standard text-to-image diffusion pipeline, SVG-T2I achieves competitive performance, reaching 0.75 on GenEval and 85.78 on DPG-Bench. This performance validates the intrinsic representational power of VFMs for generative tasks.

Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimizations to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed Reasoning Compiler) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-informed transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. MCTS incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

When analyzing our distributed ledger model, we find: - A characterization of all possible pure equilibria (although pure equilibria are not guaranteed to exist). - A natural sufficient condition, implied by Regularity (a la [Mye81]), for existence of a ``market-clearing'' pure equilibrium where Miners choose to sell all space allocated by the Distributed Ledger Protocol, and that this equilibrium is unique. - The market share of the largest miner is the relevant ``measure of decentralization'' to determine whether a market-clearing pure equilibrium exists. - Block rewards do not impact users' prices at equilibrium, when pure equilibria exist. But, higher block rewards can cause pure equilibria to exist. We also discuss aspects of our model and how they relate to blockchains deployed in practice. For example, only ``patient'' users (who are happy for their transactions to enter the blockchain under any miner) would enjoy the conclusions highlighted by our model, whereas ``impatient'' users (who are interested only for their transaction to be included in the very next block) still face monopoly pricing.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proc. of the 17th Innovations in Theoretical Computer Science (ITCS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Bench-Push: Benchmarking Pushing-based Navigation and Manipulation Tasks for Mobile Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11736v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mobile robots are increasingly deployed in cluttered environments with movable objects, posing challenges for traditional methods that prohibit interaction. In such settings, the mobile robot must go beyond traditional obstacle avoidance, leveraging pushing or nudging strategies to accomplish its goals. While research in pushing-based robotics is growing, evaluations rely on ad hoc setups, limiting reproducibility and cross-comparison. To address this, we present Bench-Push, the first unified benchmark for pushing-based mobile robot navigation and manipulation tasks.

| **[Misspecification-robust amortised simulation-based inference using variational methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05724v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in neural density estimation have enabled powerful simulation-based inference (SBI) methods that can flexibly approximate Bayesian inference for intractable stochastic models. Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (DGP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant issue for their use in real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification influence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated metrics, fixed typos, adjusted title</p></details> |

Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability. This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Docto...</summary><p>Doctoral dissertation, 121 pages, ISBN: 978-9935-9826-5-0.

| **[SOF: Sorted Opacity Fields for Fast Unbounded Surface Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19139v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian representations have significantly improved the quality and efficiency of image-based scene reconstruction. Their explicit nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments - remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude. As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2025; Project Page: https://r4dl.github.io/SOF/</p></details> |

Our approach is based on recent results on (proportional) representation in approval-based multi-winner elections. In our model, instances play a double role as voters and candidates. The approval set of each instance in the training set (acting as a voter) is defined from the concept of local set, which already exists in the literature. We then select the election winners by using a representative voting rule, and such winners are the data instances kept in the reduced training set. We evaluate our approach in two experiments involving neural network classifiers and classic machine learning classifiers (KNN and SVM). Our experiments show that, in several cases, our approach improves the performance of state-of-the-art methods, and the differences are statistically significant.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 5 figures and 32 tables</p></details> |

BEHAVIOR-1K focuses on everyday household tasks that people most want robots to assist with and these tasks introduce long-horizon mobile manipulation challenges in realistic settings, bridging the gap between current research and real-world, human-centric applications.

A Case Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07500v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of advanced analytical tools, including Machine Learning (ML) and massive data processing, has revolutionized health research, promising unprecedented accuracy in diagnosis and risk prediction. However, the rigor of these complex methods is fundamentally dependent on the quality and integrity of the underlying datasets and the validity of their statistical design. We propose an emblematic case where advanced analysis (ML/Big Data) must necessarily be subsequent to the verification of basic methodological coherence and adherence to established medical protocols, such as the STROBE Statement. This study highlights a crucial cautionary principle: sophisticated analyses amplify, rather than correct, severe methodological flaws rooted in basic design choices, leading to misleading or contradictory findings. By applying simple, standard descriptive statistical methods and established national epidemiological benchmarks to a recently published cohort study on COVID-19 vaccine outcomes and severe adverse events, like cancer, we expose multiple, statistically irreconcilable paradoxes. These paradoxes, specifically the contradictory finding of an increased cancer incidence within an exposure subgroup, concurrent with a suppressed overall Crude Incidence Rate compared to national standards, definitively invalidate the reported risk of increased cancer in the total population. We demonstrate that the observed effects are mathematical artifacts stemming from an uncorrected selection bias in the cohort construction. This analysis serves as a robust reminder that even the most complex health studies must first pass the test of basic epidemiological consistency before any conclusion drawn from subsequent advanced statistical modeling can be considered valid or publishable.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Tab...</summary><p>6 Tables; ML/Big data paper on medical data</p></details> |
| **[Referring Change Detection in Remote Sensing Imagery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11719v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Change detection in remote sensing imagery is essential for applications such as urban planning, environmental monitoring, and disaster management. Traditional change detection methods typically identify all changes between two temporal images without distinguishing the types of transitions, which can lead to results that may not align with specific user needs. Although semantic change detection methods have attempted to address this by categorizing changes into predefined classes, these methods rely on rigid class definitions and fixed model architectures, making it difficult to mix datasets with different label sets or reuse models across tasks, as the output channels are tightly coupled with the number and type of semantic classes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Referring Change Detection (RCD), which leverages natural language prompts to detect specific classes of changes in remote sensing images. By integrating language understanding with visual analysis, our approach allows users to specify the exact type of change they are interested in. However, training models for RCD is challenging due to the limited availability of annotated data and severe class imbalance in existing datasets. To address this, we propose a two-stage framework consisting of (I) \textbf{RCDNet}, a cross-modal fusion network designed for referring change detection, and (II) \textbf{RCDGen}, a diffusion-based synthetic data generation pipeline that produces realistic post-change images and change maps for a specified category using only pre-change image, without relying on semantic segmentation masks and thereby significantly lowering the barrier to scalable data creation. Experiments across multiple datasets show that our framework enables scalable and targeted change detection.

Yet, it remains unclear how feedback, through its connection to key galaxy properties, shapes the radial gas density profile in the host halo. We tackle this question using suites of the EAGLE, IllustrisTNG, and Simba cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which span a variety of feedback models. We develop a random forest algorithm that predicts the radial gas density profile within haloes from the total halo mass and five global properties of the central galaxy: gas and stellar mass; star formation rate; mass and accretion rate of the central black hole (BH). The algorithm reproduces the simulated gas density profiles with an average accuracy of $\sim$80-90% over the halo mass range $10^{9.5} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot} < M_{\rm 200c} < 10^{15} \, \mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ and redshift interval $0<z<4$. For the first time, we apply Sobol statistical sensitivity analysis to full cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, quantifying how each feature affects the gas density as a function of distance from the halo centre. Across all simulations and redshifts, the total halo mass and the gas mass of the central galaxy are the most strongly tied to the halo gas distribution, while stellar and BH properties are generally less informative. The exact relative importance of the different features depends on the feedback scenario and redshift. Our framework can be readily embedded in semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to incorporate halo gas density profiles consistent with different hydrodynamical simulations. Our work also provides a proof of concept for constraining feedback models with future observations of galaxy properties and of the surrounding gas distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to The Open Journal of Astrophysics</p></details> |

At its core is a transformer network, Part Articulation Transformer, which processes a point cloud of the input mesh using a flexible and scalable architecture to predict all the aforementioned attributes with native multi-joint support. We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences. Quantitative and qualitative results show that Particulate significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ruiningli.com/particulate</p></details> |

Addressing these factors necessitates a reassessment of inland vessel operations. This paper presents the design and development of a decision support system for ferry operations based on a shrinking-horizon optimal control framework. The problem formulation incorporates a mathematical model of the ferry's dynamics and environmental disturbances, specifically water currents and wind, which can significantly influence the dynamics. Real-world data and illustrative scenarios demonstrate the potential of the proposed system to effectively support ferry crews by providing real-time guidance. This enables enhanced operational efficiency while maintaining predefined maneuver durations. The findings suggest that optimal control applications hold substantial promise for advancing future ferry operations on inland waters.

To establish the universality of these models, we consolidate a set of results from the literature relating finite-state compressibility to optimal log-loss under Markovian and finite-state models. We also consider some theoretical and computational properties of these models when viewed as probabilistic sources. Finally, we present experimental results showcasing the potential benefit of using this family -- as models and as sources -- for compression, generation, and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 5 figures, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

While existing observability tools monitor system outputs, they cannot quantify how rapidly agentic workflows recover once reasoning coherence has been lost. We adapt classical reliability metrics-Mean Time-to-Recovery (MTTR), Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF), and related ratios-into the cognitive domain, defining MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems) as a runtime measure of cognitive recovery latency. MTTR-A quantifies the time required for a MAS to detect reasoning drift and restore consistent operation, capturing the recovery of reasoning coherence rather than infrastructural repair. A benchmark simulation using the AG~News corpus and the LangGraph orchestration framework was conducted, modeling recovery latencies across multiple reflex modes. Automated reflexes restored stability within approximately 6s on average, while human-approval interventions required about 12s. Across 200 runs, the median simulated MTTR-A was 6.21+-2.14s, MTBF=6.7+-2.14s, and NRR=0.08, demonstrating measurable runtime resilience across reflex strategies. By formalizing recovery latency as a quantifiable property of distributed reasoning-and deriving reliability bounds linking recovery time and cognitive uptime-this work establishes a foundation for runtime dependability in agentic cognition, transforming cognitive recovery from an ad-hoc process into a standardized, interpretable performance</p></details> | preprint |
| **[LUCID: Learning-Enabled Uncertainty-Aware Certification of Stochastic Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11750v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of AI-enabled systems, particularly in high-stakes domains such as autonomous driving and healthcare, has become increasingly critical. Traditional formal verification tools fall short when faced with systems that embed both opaque, black-box AI components and complex stochastic dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce LUCID (Learning-enabled Uncertainty-aware Certification of stochastIc Dynamical systems), a verification engine for certifying safety of black-box stochastic dynamical systems from a finite dataset of random state transitions. As such, LUCID is the first known tool capable of establishing quantified safety guarantees for such systems. Thanks to its modular architecture and extensive documentation, LUCID is designed for easy extensibility. LUCID employs a data-driven methodology rooted in control barrier certificates, which are learned directly from system transition data, to ensure formal safety guarantees. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where an RKHS ambiguity set is constructed that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. A key innovation within LUCID is its use of a finite Fourier kernel expansion to reformulate a semi-infinite non-convex optimization problem into a tractable linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. LUCID thus offers a robust and efficient verification framework, able to handle the complexities of modern black-box systems while providing formal guarantees of safety. These unique capabilities are demonstrated on challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted for publication in the main track of AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[REASONING COMPILER: LLM-Guided Optimizations for Efficient Model Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01374v4)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While model serving has unlocked unprecedented capabilities, the high cost of serving large-scale models continues to be a significant barrier to widespread accessibility and rapid innovation. Compiler optimizations have long driven substantial performance improvements, but existing compilers struggle with neural workloads due to the exponentially large and highly interdependent space of possible transformations. Although existing stochastic search techniques can be effective, they are often sample-inefficient and fail to leverage the structural context underlying compilation decisions. We set out to investigate the research question of whether reasoning with large language models (LLMs), without any retraining, can leverage the context-aware decision space of compiler optimizations to significantly improve sample efficiency. To that end, we introduce a novel compilation framework (dubbed Reasoning Compiler) that formulates optimization as a sequential, context-aware decision process guided by a large language model and structured Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS). The LLM acts as a proposal mechanism, suggesting hardware-informed transformations that reflect the current program state and accumulated performance feedback. MCTS incorporates the LLM-generated proposals to balance exploration and exploitation, facilitating structured, context-sensitive traversal of the expansive compiler optimization space. By achieving substantial speedups with markedly fewer samples than leading neural compilers, our approach demonstrates the potential of LLM-guided reasoning to transform the landscape of compiler optimization.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

The device supports a gallery mode, in which users browse files on flash disks, hard disk drives, or microSD cards, and a live mode which renders feeds of cameras connected to it. Its design is specifically aimed at addressing pragmatic challenges, such as changing light, random orientation, curvature or partial coverage of text, low resolution, and slightly visible text. The steps of the processing process are divided into four steps: image acquisition and preprocessing, textual elements detection with the help of DBNet++ (Differentiable Binarization Network Plus) model, BART (Bidirectional Auto-Regressive Transformers) model that classifies detected textual elements, and the presentation of the results through a user interface written in Python and PyQt5. All the stages are connected in such a way that they form a smooth workflow. The system achieved a text recognition rate of about 94.62% when tested over ten hours on the mentioned Total-Text dataset, that includes high resolution images, created so as to represent a wide range of problematic conditions.

We focus on mixed-motive social dilemmas instantiated as a \textit{Tragedy of the Commons} environment from the Melting Pot suite, where we systematically compare human groups and Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents, each evaluated with and without explicit communication. Cooperative resilience is assessed under a continuously disruptive condition induced by a persistent unsustainable consumption bot, together with intermittent environmental shocks implemented as stochastic removal of shared resources across scenarios. This experimental design establishes a benchmark for cooperative resilience across agent architectures and interaction modalities, constituting a key step toward systematically comparing humans and LLM-based agents. Using this framework, we find that human groups with communication achieve the highest cooperative resilience compared to all other groups. Communication also improves the resilience of LLM agents, but their performance remains below human levels. Motivated by the performance of humans, we further examine a long-horizon setting with harsher environmental conditions, where humans sustain the shared resource and maintain high resilience in diverse disruption scenarios. Together, these results suggest that human decision-making under adverse social conditions can inform the design of artificial agents that promote prosocial and resilient behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Suppl...</summary><p>Supplementary material in https://github.com/mavivi95/resilience_humans_vs_LLM/blob/main/Supplementary_File.pdf</p></details> |

However, existing research communities address these challenges in isolation. Continual Learning (CL) focuses on long-term retention and mitigating catastrophic forgetting, often without strict real-time constraints. Stream Learning (SL) emphasizes rapid, efficient adaptation to high-frequency data streams, but typically neglects forgetting. Recent efforts have tried to combine these paradigms, yet no clear algorithmic overlap exists. We argue that large in-context tabular models (LTMs) provide a natural bridge for Streaming Continual Learning (SCL). In our view, unbounded streams should be summarized on-the-fly into compact sketches that can be consumed by LTMs. This recovers the classical SL motivation of compressing massive streams with fixed-size guarantees, while simultaneously aligning with the experience-replay desiderata of CL. To clarify this bridge, we show how the SL and CL communities implicitly adopt a divide-to-conquer strategy to manage the tension between plasticity (performing well on the current distribution) and stability (retaining past knowledge), while also imposing a minimal complexity constraint that motivates diversification (avoiding redundancy in what is stored) and retrieval (re-prioritizing past information when needed). Within this perspective, we propose structuring SCL with LTMs around two core principles of data selection for in-context learning: (1) distribution matching, which balances plasticity and stability, and (2) distribution compression, which controls memory size through diversification and retrieval mechanisms.</p></details> | <details><summary>Strea...</summary><p>Streaming Continual Learning AAAI Bridge 2026</p></details> |

While recent generative models can synthesize useful data for individual tasks, they do not exploit the compositional structure of robotic domains and struggle to generalize to unseen task combinations. We propose a semantic compositional diffusion transformer that factorizes transitions into robot-, object-, obstacle-, and objective-specific components and learns their interactions through attention. Once trained on a limited subset of tasks, we show that our model can zero-shot generate high-quality transitions from which we can learn control policies for unseen task combinations. Then, we introduce an iterative self-improvement procedure in which synthetic data is validated via offline reinforcement learning and incorporated into subsequent training rounds. Our approach substantially improves zero-shot performance over monolithic and hard-coded compositional baselines, ultimately solving nearly all held-out tasks and demonstrating the emergence of meaningful compositional structure in the learned representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corrected reference chronological order and added acknowledgements; results unchanged</p></details> |

Given a single portrait image, a driving video, and camera trajectories, our method animates the portrait by transferring facial expressions and head movements from the driving video while simultaneously enabling novel view synthesis from arbitrary viewpoints. We utilize a pre-trained image encoder to extract facial expression latents from the driving video as control signals for animation generation. Such latents implicitly capture nuanced facial expression dynamics with identity and pose information disentangled, and they are efficiently injected into the video diffusion transformer through our proposed expression controller. For camera and head pose control, we employ Plücker ray maps and normal maps rendered from 3D body mesh tracking. To train our model, we curate a large-scale synthetic dataset containing diverse combinations of camera viewpoints, head poses, and facial expression dynamics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in realism, expressiveness, control accuracy, and view consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://tangjiapeng.github.io/FactorPortrait/</p></details> |
| **[New Entropy Measures for Tries with Applications to the XBWT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11618v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Entropy quantifies the number of bits required to store objects under certain given assumptions. While this is a well established concept for strings, in the context of tries the state-of-the-art regarding entropies is less developed. The standard trie worst-case entropy considers the set of tries with a fixed number of nodes and alphabet size. However, this approach does not consider the frequencies of the symbols in the trie, thus failing to capture the compressibility of tries with skewed character distributions. On the other hand, the label entropy [FOCS '05], proposed for node-labeled trees, does not take into account the tree topology, which has to be stored separately. In this paper, we introduce two new entropy measures for tries - worst-case and empirical - which overcome the two aforementioned limitations. Notably, our entropies satisfy similar properties of their string counterparts, thereby becoming very natural generalizations of the (simpler) string case. Indeed, our empirical entropy is closely related to the worst-case entropy and is reachable through a natural extension of arithmetic coding from strings to tries. Moreover we show that, similarly to the FM-index for strings [JACM '05], the XBWT of a trie can be compressed and efficiently indexed within our k-th order empirical entropy plus o(n) bits, with n being the number of nodes. Interestingly, the space usage of this encoding includes the trie topology and the upper-bound holds for every k sufficiently small, simultaneously. This XBWT encoding is always strictly smaller than the original one [JACM '09] and we show that in certain cases it is asymptotically smaller.</p></details> | 32 pages, 4 figures |

However, with the rapid evolution of machine intelligence, the target of compression has shifted from task-specific virtual models to Embodied agents operating in real-world environments. To address the communication constraints of Embodied AI in multi-agent systems and ensure real-time task execution, this paper introduces, for the first time, the scientific problem of Embodied Image Compression. We establish a standardized benchmark, EmbodiedComp, to facilitate systematic evaluation under ultra-low bitrate conditions in a closed-loop setting. Through extensive empirical studies in both simulated and real-world settings, we demonstrate that existing Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) fail to reliably perform even simple manipulation tasks when compressed below the Embodied bitrate threshold. We anticipate that EmbodiedComp will catalyze the development of domain-specific compression tailored for Embodied agents , thereby accelerating the Embodied AI deployment in the Real-world.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding. MapFormers have broad applications in both neuroscience and AI, by explaining the neural mechanisms giving rise to cognitive maps, while allowing these relation models to be learned at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (29 with appendix), 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Free-Lunch Color-Texture Disentanglement for Stylized Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14275v4)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models have transformed image generation, enabling significant progress in stylized generation using only a few style reference images. However, current diffusion-based methods struggle with fine-grained style customization due to challenges in controlling multiple style attributes, such as color and texture. This paper introduces the first tuning-free approach to achieve free-lunch color-texture disentanglement in stylized T2I generation, addressing the need for independently controlled style elements for the Disentangled Stylized Image Generation (DisIG) problem. Our approach leverages the Image-Prompt Additivity property in the CLIP image embedding space to develop techniques for separating and extracting Color-Texture Embeddings (CTE) from individual color and texture reference images. To ensure that the color palette of the generated image aligns closely with the color reference, we apply a whitening and coloring transformation to enhance color consistency. Additionally, to prevent texture loss due to the signal-leak bias inherent in diffusion training, we introduce a noise term that preserves textural fidelity during the Regularized Whitening and Coloring Transformation (RegWCT). Through these methods, our Style Attributes Disentanglement approach (SADis) delivers a more precise and customizable solution for stylized image generation. Experiments on images from the WikiArt and StyleDrop datasets demonstrate that, both qualitatively and quantitatively, SADis surpasses state-of-the-art stylization methods in the DisIG task.Code is released at https://deepffff.github.io/sadis.github.io/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS2025.

Here, $\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ denotes the class of promise problems that admit two-message quantum interactive proof systems in which the honest prover is typically \textit{computationally unbounded}, and $\text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ denotes the complement of $\mathsf{QIP(2)}$. We slightly improve this upper bound to $\mathsf{QIP(2)} \cap \text{co-}\mathsf{QIP(2)}$ with a quantum linear-space honest prover. A similar improvement also applies to the upper bound for the non-interactive variant $\mathsf{NIQSZK}$. Our main techniques are an algorithmic version of the Holevo-Helstrom measurement and the Uhlmann transform, both implementable in quantum linear space, implying polynomial-time complexity in the state dimension, using the recent space-efficient quantum singular value transformation of Le Gall, Liu, and Wang (CC, to appear).</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 2 figures.

| **[In-Context Learning for Seismic Data Processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11575v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Seismic processing transforms raw data into subsurface images essential for geophysical applications. Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency. These results establish ContextSeisNet as a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available under https://codeberg.org/fuchsfa/in-context-learning-seismic</p></details> |

Discretizing image data into tokens is a critical step for effectively integrating images with Transformer and other architectures. Although the Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (DDCM) pioneered the use of pre-trained diffusion models for image tokenization, it strictly relies on the traditional discrete-time DDPM architecture. Consequently, it fails to adapt to modern continuous-time variants-such as Flow Matching and Consistency Models-and suffers from inefficient sampling in high-noise regions. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Generalized Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models (gDDCM). We establish a unified theoretical framework and introduce a generic "De-noise and Back-trace" sampling strategy. By integrating a deterministic ODE denoising step with a residual-aligned noise injection step, our method resolves the challenge of adaptation. Furthermore, we introduce a backtracking parameter $p$ and significantly enhance tokenization ability. Extensive experiments on CIFAR10 and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate that gDDCM achieves comprehensive compatibility with mainstream diffusion variants and significantly outperforms DDCM in terms of reconstruction quality and perceptual fidelity.</p></details> | in Chinese language |

Providing an objective and cost-effective solution, AES standardises the assessment of extended responses. Although substantial research has been conducted in this domain, recent investigations reveal that alternative deep-learning architectures outperform transformer-based models. Despite the successful dominance in the performance of the transformer architectures across various other tasks, this discrepancy has prompted a need to enrich transformer-based AES models through contextual enrichment. This study delves into diverse contextual factors using the ASAP-AES dataset, analysing their impact on transformer-based model performance. Our most effective model, augmented with multiple contextual dimensions, achieves a mean Quadratic Weighted Kappa score of 0.823 across the entire essay dataset and 0.8697 when trained on individual essay sets. Evidently surpassing prior transformer-based models, this augmented approach only underperforms relative to the state-of-the-art deep learning model trained essay-set-wise by an average of 3.83\% while exhibiting superior performance in three of the eight sets. Importantly, this enhancement is orthogonal to architecture-based advancements and seamlessly adaptable to any AES model. Consequently, this contextual augmentation methodology presents a versatile technique for refining AES capabilities, contributing to automated grading and evaluation evolution in educational settings.</p></details> | MSc Dissertation |
| **[Learning Unmasking Policies for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09106v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion (Large) Language Models (dLLMs) now match the downstream performance of their autoregressive counterparts on many tasks, while holding the promise of being more efficient during inference. One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths. However, we also observe that their performance degrades when applied to out-of-domain data, and that fine-grained tuning of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off can be challenging with our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2: F...</summary><p>V2: Fixed typo in author list.

Conventional physics models require detailed environmental knowledge, while stochastic replay methods are constrained by the limited diversity of measured channels and often fail to generalize to unseen scenarios, reducing their practical applicability. To address these challenges, we propose StableUASim, a pre-trained conditional latent diffusion surrogate model that captures the stochastic dynamics of underwater acoustic communication channels. Leveraging generative modeling, StableUASim produces diverse and statistically realistic channel realizations, while supporting conditional generation from specific measurement samples. Pre-training enables rapid adaptation to new environments using minimal additional data, and the autoencoder latent representation facilitates efficient channel analysis and compression. Experimental results demonstrate that StableUASim accurately reproduces key channel characteristics and communication performance, providing a scalable, data-efficient, and physically consistent surrogate model for both system design and machine learning-driven underwater applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated references with DOIs</p></details> |

Leveraging known techniques, we describe an approach where multiple complex functions are encoded onto auxiliary qubits. Applying the proposed scheme for two functions $f$ and $g$, their pointwise product $f(x)g(x)$ is shown to naturally form as the coefficients of part of the resulting quantum state. Adhering to the convolution theorem, we then demonstrate how the convolution $f*g$ can be constructed. Similarly to related work, this involves the encoding of the Fourier coefficients $\mathcal{F}[f]$ and $\mathcal{F}[g]$, which facilitates their pointwise multiplication, followed by the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform. We discuss the simulation of these techniques, their integration into an extended \verb|quantumaudio| package for audio signal processing, and present initial experimental validations. This work offers a promising avenue for quantum signal processing, with potential applications in areas such as quantum-enhanced audio manipulation and synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at ISQCMC '25: 3rd International Symposium on Quantum Computing and Musical Creativity</p></details> |

Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2025 Workshop on Structured Probabilistic Inference and Generative Modeling</p></details> |

However, the black-box nature of state-of-the-art models remains a significant barrier to adoption, as high-stakes safety decisions demand verifiable structural insights alongside predictive performance. To address this, we propose a novel multi-task learning (MTL) framework designed to jointly enhance accuracy and interpretability. Our architecture integrates a shared chemical language model with task-specific attention modules. By imposing an L1 sparsity penalty on these modules, the framework is constrained to focus on a minimal set of salient molecular fragments for each distinct toxicity endpoint. The resulting framework is trained end-to-end and is readily adaptable to various transformer-based backbones. Evaluated on the ClinTox, SIDER, and Tox21 benchmark datasets, our approach consistently outperforms both single-task and standard MTL baselines. Crucially, the sparse attention weights provide chemically intuitive visualizations that reveal the specific fragments influencing predictions, thereby enhancing insight into the model's decision-making process.</p></details> | 6 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Collaborative Reconstruction and Repair for Multi-class Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11401v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Industrial anomaly detection is a challenging open-set task that aims to identify unknown anomalous patterns deviating from normal data distribution. To avoid the significant memory consumption and limited generalizability brought by building separate models per class, we focus on developing a unified framework for multi-class anomaly detection. However, under this challenging setting, conventional reconstruction-based networks often suffer from an identity mapping problem, where they directly replicate input features regardless of whether they are normal or anomalous, resulting in detection failures. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel framework termed Collaborative Reconstruction and Repair (CRR), which transforms the reconstruction to repairation. First, we optimize the decoder to reconstruct normal samples while repairing synthesized anomalies. Consequently, it generates distinct representations for anomalous regions and similar representations for normal areas compared to the encoder's output. Second, we implement feature-level random masking to ensure that the representations from decoder contain sufficient local information. Finally, to minimize detection errors arising from the discrepancies between feature representations from the encoder and decoder, we train a segmentation network supervised by synthetic anomaly masks, thereby enhancing localization performance. Extensive experiments on industrial datasets that CRR effectively mitigates the identity mapping issue and achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-class industrial anomaly detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Data Intelligence 2025</p></details> |

While recent methods like diffusion and auto-regressive models (i.e., transformer) have advanced the field, generative adversarial networks (GANs) remain highly competitive due to their training efficiency and strong data generation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce Tabular Auto-Encoder Generative Adversarial Network (TAEGAN), a novel GAN-based framework that leverages a masked auto-encoder as the generator. TAEGAN is the first to incorporate self-supervised warmup training of generator into tabular GANs. It enhances GAN stability and exposes the generator to richer information beyond the discriminator's feedback. Additionally, we propose a novel sampling method tailored for imbalanced or skewed data and an improved loss function to better capture data distribution and correlations. We evaluate TAEGAN against seven state-of-the-art synthetic tabular data generation algorithms. Results from eight datasets show that TAEGAN outperforms all baselines on five datasets, achieving a 27% overall utility boost over the best-performing baseline while maintaining a model size less than 5% of the best-performing baseline model.

However, existing methods are largely confined to single-agent scenarios, overlooking the physically plausible interplay essential for multi-agent interactions. To bridge this gap, we propose InterAgent, the first end-to-end framework for text-driven physics-based multi-agent humanoid control. At its core, we introduce an autoregressive diffusion transformer equipped with multi-stream blocks, which decouples proprioception, exteroception, and action to mitigate cross-modal interference while enabling synergistic coordination. We further propose a novel interaction graph exteroception representation that explicitly captures fine-grained joint-to-joint spatial dependencies to facilitate network learning. Additionally, within it we devise a sparse edge-based attention mechanism that dynamically prunes redundant connections and emphasizes critical inter-agent spatial relations, thereby enhancing the robustness of interaction modeling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that InterAgent consistently outperforms multiple strong baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance. It enables producing coherent, physically plausible, and semantically faithful multi-agent behaviors from only text prompts. Our code and data will be released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://binlee26.github.io/InterAgent-Page</p></details> |

This study refutes claims about formalistic judging in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) by developing automated methods to detect and classify judicial reasoning in Czech Supreme Courts' decisions using state-of-the-art natural language processing methods. We create the MADON dataset of 272 decisions from two Czech Supreme Courts with expert annotations of 9,183 paragraphs with eight argument types and holistic formalism labels for supervised training and evaluation. Using a corpus of 300k Czech court decisions, we adapt transformer LLMs for Czech legal domain by continued pretraining and experiment with methods to address dataset imbalance including asymmetric loss and class weighting. The best models successfully detect argumentative paragraphs (82.6\% macro-F1), classify traditional types of legal argument (77.5\% macro-F1), and classify decisions as formalistic/non-formalistic (83.2\% macro-F1). Our three-stage pipeline combining ModernBERT, Llama 3.1, and traditional feature-based machine learning achieves promising results for decision classification while reducing computational costs and increasing explainability. Empirically, we challenge prevailing narratives about CEE formalism. This work shows that legal argument mining enables reliable judicial philosophy classification and shows the potential of legal argument mining for other important tasks in computational legal studies.

This paper introduces the first comprehensive, event-driven data infrastructure for Aave V3 spanning six major EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Avalanche, and Base) from respective deployment blocks through October 2025.

Using an open-source Python pipeline with dynamic batch sizing and automatic sharding (each file less than or equal to 1 million rows), we ensure strict chronological ordering and full reproducibility. The resulting publicly available dataset enables granular analysis of capital flows, interest rate dynamics, liquidation cascades, and cross-chain user behavior, providing a foundational resource for future studies on decentralized lending markets and systemic risk.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Translating Informal Proofs into Formal Proofs Using a Chain of States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10317v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of translating informal mathematical proofs expressed in natural language into formal proofs in Lean4 under a constrained computational budget. Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states. Empirical results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher proof success rates.</p></details> | 31 pages, 5 figures |

This technique significantly reduces the need for dense annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene, WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes, especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings. This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision, namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios.

While traditional beam prediction approaches primarily rely on in-band beam training, recent advances have started to explore multimodal sensing to extract environmental semantics for enhanced prediction. However, the performance of existing multimodal fusion methods degrades significantly in real-world settings because they are vulnerable to missing data caused by sensor blockage, poor lighting, or GPS dropouts. To address this challenge, we propose AMBER ({A}daptive multimodal {M}ask transformer for {BE}am p{R}ediction), a novel end-to-end framework that processes temporal sequences of image, LiDAR, radar, and GPS data, while adaptively handling arbitrary missing-modality cases. AMBER introduces learnable modality tokens and a missing-modality-aware mask to prevent cross-modal noise propagation, along with a learnable fusion token and multihead attention to achieve robust modality-specific information distillation and feature-level fusion. Furthermore, a class-former-aided modality alignment (CMA) module and temporal-aware positional embedding are incorporated to preserve temporal coherence and ensure semantic alignment across modalities, facilitating the learning of modality-invariant and temporally consistent representations for beam prediction. Extensive experiments on the real-world DeepSense6G dataset demonstrate that AMBER significantly outperforms existing multimodal learning baselines. In particular, it maintains high beam prediction accuracy and robustness even under severe missing-modality scenarios, validating its effectiveness and practical applicability.</p></details> | 12 pages, 9 figures |

At its core is a transformer network, Part Articulation Transformer, which processes a point cloud of the input mesh using a flexible and scalable architecture to predict all the aforementioned attributes with native multi-joint support. We train the network end-to-end on a diverse collection of articulated 3D assets from public datasets. During inference, Particulate lifts the network's feed-forward prediction to the input mesh, yielding a fully articulated 3D model in seconds, much faster than prior approaches that require per-object optimization. Particulate can also accurately infer the articulated structure of AI-generated 3D assets, enabling full-fledged extraction of articulated 3D objects from a single (real or synthetic) image when combined with an off-the-shelf image-to-3D generator. We further introduce a new challenging benchmark for 3D articulation estimation curated from high-quality public 3D assets, and redesign the evaluation protocol to be more consistent with human preferences. Quantitative and qualitative results show that Particulate significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://ruiningli.com/particulate</p></details> |

We present BLURR, a lightweight inference wrapper that can be plugged into existing VLA controllers without retraining or changing model checkpoints. Instantiated on the pi-zero VLA controller, BLURR keeps the original observation interfaces and accelerates control by combining an instruction prefix key value cache, mixed precision execution, and a single step rollout schedule that reduces per step computation. In our SimplerEnv based evaluation, BLURR maintains task success rates comparable to the original controller while significantly lowering effective FLOPs and wall clock latency. We also build an interactive web demo that allows users to switch between controllers and toggle inference options in real time while watching manipulation episodes. This highlights BLURR as a practical approach for deploying modern VLA policies under tight compute budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures.

Using this framework, we show that two procedures for false discovery rate (FDR) control -- the Benjamini-Yekutieli procedure for dependent p-values, and the e-Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for dependent e-values -- can be improved through randomization. We also improve the Hommel test under dependence, and post-selection inference procedures for confidence intervals with false coverage rate (FCR) that allow for arbitrary selection rules and dependence.

Traditional formal verification tools fall short when faced with systems that embed both opaque, black-box AI components and complex stochastic dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce LUCID (Learning-enabled Uncertainty-aware Certification of stochastIc Dynamical systems), a verification engine for certifying safety of black-box stochastic dynamical systems from a finite dataset of random state transitions. As such, LUCID is the first known tool capable of establishing quantified safety guarantees for such systems. Thanks to its modular architecture and extensive documentation, LUCID is designed for easy extensibility. LUCID employs a data-driven methodology rooted in control barrier certificates, which are learned directly from system transition data, to ensure formal safety guarantees. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), where an RKHS ambiguity set is constructed that can be inflated to robustify the result to out-of-distribution behavior. A key innovation within LUCID is its use of a finite Fourier kernel expansion to reformulate a semi-infinite non-convex optimization problem into a tractable linear program. The resulting spectral barrier allows us to leverage the fast Fourier transform to generate the relaxed problem efficiently, offering a scalable yet distributionally robust framework for verifying safety. LUCID thus offers a robust and efficient verification framework, able to handle the complexities of modern black-box systems while providing formal guarantees of safety. These unique capabilities are demonstrated on challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>The m...</summary><p>The manuscript has been accepted for publication in the main track of AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Despite this potential, training large-scale text-to-image diffusion models entirely within the VFM representation space remains largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we scale the SVG (Self-supervised representations for Visual Generation) framework, proposing SVG-T2I to support high-quality text-to-image synthesis directly in the VFM feature domain. By leveraging a standard text-to-image diffusion pipeline, SVG-T2I achieves competitive performance, reaching 0.75 on GenEval and 85.78 on DPG-Bench. This performance validates the intrinsic representational power of VFMs for generative tasks. We fully open-source the project, including the autoencoder and generation model, together with their training, inference, evaluation pipelines, and pre-trained weights, to facilitate further research in representation-driven visual generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code Repository: https://github.com/KlingTeam/SVG-T2I; Model Weights: https://huggingface.co/KlingTeam/SVG-T2I</p></details> |

Although these methods have demonstrated reliable posterior estimation when the simulator accurately represents the underlying data generative process (DGP), recent work has shown that they perform poorly in the presence of model misspecification. This poses a significant issue for their use in real-world problems, due to simulators always misrepresenting the true DGP to a certain degree. In this paper, we introduce robust variational neural posterior estimation (RVNP), a method which addresses the problem of misspecification in amortised SBI by bridging the simulation-to-reality gap using variational inference and error modelling. We test RVNP on multiple benchmark tasks, including using real data from astronomy, and show that it can recover robust posterior inference in a data-driven manner without adopting hyperparameters or priors governing the misspecification influence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated metrics, fixed typos, adjusted title</p></details> |

Their explicit nature facilitates real-time rendering and fast optimization, yet extracting accurate surfaces - particularly in large-scale, unbounded environments - remains a difficult task. Many existing methods rely on approximate depth estimates and global sorting heuristics, which can introduce artifacts and limit the fidelity of the reconstructed mesh. In this paper, we present Sorted Opacity Fields (SOF), a method designed to recover detailed surfaces from 3D Gaussians with both speed and precision. Our approach improves upon prior work by introducing hierarchical resorting and a robust formulation of Gaussian depth, which better aligns with the level-set. To enhance mesh quality, we incorporate a level-set regularizer operating on the opacity field and introduce losses that encourage geometrically-consistent primitive shapes. In addition, we develop a parallelized Marching Tetrahedra algorithm tailored to our opacity formulation, reducing meshing time by up to an order of magnitude. As demonstrated by our quantitative evaluation, SOF achieves higher reconstruction accuracy while cutting total processing time by more than a factor of three. These results mark a step forward in turning efficient Gaussian-based rendering into equally efficient geometry extraction.</p></details> | <details><summary>SIGGR...</summary><p>SIGGRAPH Asia 2025; Project Page: https://r4dl.github.io/SOF/</p></details> |

Traditional PIV approaches typically depend on tuning parameters specific to the imaging setup, making the performance sensitive to variations in illumination, flow conditions, and seeding density. On the other hand, even state-of-the-art machine learning methods for flow quantification are fragile outside their training set. In our experiments, we observed that flow quantification would improve if different tunings (or algorithms) were applied to different regions of the same image pair. In this work, we parallelize the instantaneous flow quantification with multiple algorithms and adopt a consensus framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, seamlessly incorporating priors such as smoothness and incompressibility. We perform several numerical experiments to demonstrate the benefits of this approach. For instance, we achieve a decrease in end-point-error of up to 20% of a dense-inverse-search estimator at an inference rate of 60Hz, and we show how this performance boost can be increased further with outlier rejection. Our method is implemented in JAX, effectively exploiting hardware acceleration, and integrated in Flow Gym, enabling (i) reproducible comparisons with the state-of-the-art, (ii) testing different base algorithms, (iii) straightforward deployment for active fluids control applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/antonioterpin/flowgym</p></details> |

A control-focused decoding stage and citation gate enforce syntactic and factual grounding by constraining outputs to ontology-linked terms, while evaluation metrics quantify both linguistic quality and ontological accuracy. Feedback and future extensions, including semantic retrieval and iterative validation, further enhance the system's interpretability and reliability.

To address this, we present a probabilistic hierarchical Bayesian model that deconvolves bulk RNA-seq data into constituent cell-type expression profiles and proportions, leveraging a high-resolution single-cell reference. We apply our model to human endometrial tissue across the menstrual cycle, a context characterized by dramatic hormone-driven cellular composition changes. Our extended framework provides a principled inference of cell type proportions and cell-specific gene expression changes across cycle phases. We demonstrate the model's structure, priors, and inference strategy in detail, and we validate its performance with simulations and comparisons to existing methods. The results reveal dynamic shifts in epithelial, stromal, and immune cell fractions between menstrual phases, and identify cell-type-specific differential gene expression associated with endometrial function (e.g., decidualization markers in stromal cells during the secretory phase). We further conduct robustness tests and show that our Bayesian approach is resilient to reference mismatches and noise. Finally, we discuss the biological significance of our findings, potential clinical implications for fertility and endometrial disorders, and future directions, including integration of spatial transcriptomics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is withdrawn due to issues with attribution and citation accuracy</p></details> |

However, multiple hypothesis testing after integration can be biased due to data-dependent processes. We introduce a robust post-integrated inference method that accounts for latent heterogeneity by utilizing control outcomes. Leveraging causal interpretations, we derive nonparametric identifiability of the direct effects using negative control outcomes. By utilizing surrogate control outcomes as an extension of negative control outcomes, we develop semiparametric inference on projected direct effect estimands, accounting for hidden mediators, confounders, and moderators. These estimands remain statistically meaningful under model misspecifications and with error-prone embeddings. We provide bias quantifications and finite-sample linear expansions with uniform concentration bounds. The proposed doubly robust estimators are consistent and efficient under minimal assumptions and potential misspecification, facilitating data-adaptive estimation with machine learning algorithms. Our proposal is evaluated using random forests through simulations and analysis of single-cell CRISPR perturbed datasets, which may contain potential unmeasured confounders.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages for the main text, 27 pages for the appendix, 6 figures for the main text, 7 figures for the appendix</p></details> |

In the context of fetal MRI, high-resolution 3D reconstruction of the brain from motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D acquisitions is a prerequisite for accurate neurodevelopmental diagnosis. While implicit neural representations (INRs) have recently established state-of-the-art performance in self-supervised slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), they suffer from a critical computational bottleneck: accurately modeling the image acquisition physics requires expensive stochastic Monte Carlo sampling to approximate the point spread function (PSF). In this work, we propose a shift from neural network based implicit representations to Gaussian based explicit representations. By parameterizing the HR 3D image volume as a field of anisotropic Gaussian primitives, we leverage the property of Gaussians being closed under convolution and thus derive a \textit{closed-form analytical solution} for the forward model. This formulation reduces the previously intractable acquisition integral to an exact covariance addition ($\mathbfΣ_{obs} = \mathbfΣ_{HR} + \mathbfΣ_{PSF}$), effectively bypassing the need for compute-intensive stochastic sampling while ensuring exact gradient propagation. We demonstrate that our approach matches the reconstruction quality of self-supervised state-of-the-art SVR frameworks while delivering a 5$\times$--10$\times$ speed-up on neonatal and fetal data. With convergence often reached in under 30 seconds, our framework paves the way towards translation into clinical routine of real-time fetal 3D MRI.

To address these, we propose DiffRWKVIR, a novel framework unifying Test-Time Training (TTT) with efficient diffusion. Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) Omni-Scale 2D State Evolution extends RWKV's location-dependent parameterization to hierarchical multi-directional 2D scanning, enabling global contextual awareness with linear complexity O(L); (2) Chunk-Optimized Flash Processing accelerates intra-chunk parallelism by 3.2x via contiguous chunk processing (O(LCd) complexity), reducing sequential dependencies and computational overhead; (3) Prior-Guided Efficient Diffusion extracts a compact Image Prior Representation (IPR) in only 5-20 steps, proving 45% faster training/inference than DiffIR while solving computational inefficiency in denoising. Evaluated across super-resolution and inpainting benchmarks (Set5, Set14, BSD100, Urban100, Places365), DiffRWKVIR outperforms SwinIR, HAT, and MambaIR/v2 in PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS, and efficiency metrics.

Moreover, grounding language in 3D scenes has proven to be an effective strategy for 3D scene understanding. Current Language Gaussian Splatting line of work fall into three main groups: (i) per-scene optimization-based, (ii) per-scene optimization-free, and (iii) generalizable approach. However, most of them are evaluated only on rendered 2D views of a handful of scenes and viewpoints close to the training views, limiting ability and insight into holistic 3D understanding. To address this gap, we propose the first large-scale benchmark that systematically assesses these three groups of methods directly in 3D space, evaluating on 1060 scenes across three indoor datasets and one outdoor dataset. Benchmark results demonstrate a clear advantage of the generalizable paradigm, particularly in relaxing the scene-specific limitation, enabling fast feed-forward inference on novel scenes, and achieving superior segmentation performance. We further introduce GaussianWorld-49K a carefully curated 3DGS dataset comprising around 49K diverse indoor and outdoor scenes obtained from multiple sources, with which we demonstrate the generalizable approach could harness strong data priors.

Traditional methods face challenges, such as noisy data, and manual parameter tuning, among others. Recently deep learning approaches have proposed alternative solutions to some of these problems. However, important challenges of existing deep learning approaches are spatially inconsistent results across neighboring seismic gathers and lack of user-control. We address these limitations by introducing ContextSeisNet, an in-context learning model, to seismic demultiple processing. Our approach conditions predictions on a support set of spatially related example pairs: neighboring common-depth point gathers from the same seismic line and their corresponding labels. This allows the model to learn task-specific processing behavior at inference time by observing how similar gathers should be processed, without any retraining. This method provides both flexibility through user-defined examples and improved lateral consistency across seismic lines. On synthetic data, ContextSeisNet outperforms a U-Net baseline quantitatively and demonstrates enhanced spatial coherence between neighboring gathers. On field data, our model achieves superior lateral consistency compared to both traditional Radon demultiple and the U-Net baseline. Relative to the U-Net, ContextSeisNet also delivers improved near-offset performance and more complete multiple removal. Notably, ContextSeisNet achieves comparable field data performance despite being trained on 90% less data, demonstrating substantial data efficiency. These results establish ContextSeisNet as a practical approach for spatially consistent seismic demultiple with potential applicability to other seismic processing tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code available under https://codeberg.org/fuchsfa/in-context-learning-seismic</p></details> |

Much existing work uses only genetic data for species delimitation, often employing some kind of cluster analysis. This can be misleading, because geographically distant groups of individuals can be genetically quite different even if they belong to the same species. We investigate the problem of testing whether two potentially separated groups of individuals can belong to a single species or not based on genetic and spatial data. Existing methods such as the partial Mantel test and jackknife-based distance-distance regression are considered. New approaches, i.e., an adaptation of a mixed effects model, a bootstrap approach, and a jackknife version of partial Mantel, are proposed. All these methods address the issue that distance data violate the independence assumption for standard inference regarding correlation and regression; a standard linear regression is also considered. The approaches are compared on simulated meta-populations generated with SLiM and GSpace - two software packages that can simulate spatially-explicit genetic data at an individual level. Simulations show that the new jackknife version of the partial Mantel test provides a good compromise between power and respecting the nominal type I error rate. Mixed-effects models have larger power than jackknife-based methods, but tend to display type I error rates slightly above the significance level. An application on brassy ringlets concludes the paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Decem...</summary><p>December 2025 update: 41 pages, 9 figures incl. Appendix</p></details> |
| **[Learning Unmasking Policies for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09106v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion (Large) Language Models (dLLMs) now match the downstream performance of their autoregressive counterparts on many tasks, while holding the promise of being more efficient during inference. One particularly successful variant is masked discrete diffusion, in which a buffer filled with special mask tokens is progressively replaced with tokens sampled from the model's vocabulary. Efficiency can be gained by unmasking several tokens in parallel, but doing too many at once risks degrading the generation quality. Thus, one critical design aspect of dLLMs is the sampling procedure that selects, at each step of the diffusion process, which tokens to replace. Indeed, recent work has found that heuristic strategies such as confidence thresholding lead to both higher quality and token throughput compared to random unmasking. However, such heuristics have downsides: they require manual tuning, and we observe that their performance degrades with larger buffer sizes. In this work, we instead propose to train sampling procedures using reinforcement learning. Specifically, we formalize masked diffusion sampling as a Markov decision process in which the dLLM serves as the environment, and propose a lightweight policy architecture based on a single-layer transformer that maps dLLM token confidences to unmasking decisions. Our experiments show that these trained policies match the performance of state-of-the-art heuristics when combined with semi-autoregressive generation, while outperforming them in the full diffusion setting. We also examine the transferability of these policies, finding that they can generalize to new underlying dLLMs and longer sequence lengths. However, we also observe that their performance degrades when applied to out-of-domain data, and that fine-grained tuning of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off can be challenging with our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2: F...</summary><p>V2: Fixed typo in author list.

During iterative design, adjustments to the geometric shape inevitably require synchronized edits to the underlying parametric sequence, called geometry-driven parametric CAD editing. The task calls for 1) preserving the original sequence's structure, 2) ensuring each edit's semantic validity, and 3) maintaining high shape fidelity to the target shape, all under scarce editing data triplets. We present CADMorph, an iterative plan-generate-verify framework that orchestrates pretrained domain-specific foundation models during inference: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. In the planning stage, cross-attention maps from the P2S model pinpoint the segments that need modification and offer editing masks. The MPP model then infills these masks with semantically valid edits in the generation stage. During verification, the P2S model embeds each candidate sequence in shape-latent space, measures its distance to the target shape, and selects the closest one. The three stages leverage the inherent geometric consciousness and design knowledge in pretrained priors, and thus tackle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively. Besides, both P2S and MPP models are trained without triplet data, bypassing the data-scarcity bottleneck. CADMorph surpasses GPT-4o and specialized CAD baselines, and supports downstream applications such as iterative editing and reverse-engineering enhancement.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

This paper presents a multi-party conversational system that combines multimodal perception (voice direction of arrival, speaker diarisation, face recognition) with a large language model for response generation. Implemented on the Furhat robot, the system was evaluated with 30 participants across two scenarios: (i) parallel, separate conversations and (ii) shared group discussion. Results show that the system maintains coherent and engaging conversations, achieving high addressee accuracy in parallel settings (92.6%) and strong face recognition reliability (80-94%). Participants reported clear social presence and positive engagement, although technical barriers such as audio-based speaker recognition errors and response latency affected the fluidity of group interactions. The results highlight both the promise and limitations of LLM-based multi-party interaction and outline concrete directions for improving multimodal cue integration and responsiveness in future social robots.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables; 2 appendices</p></details> |

This study explores a novel approach that integrates an adverse event (AE) ontology into a zero--inflated negative binomial model to improve ADR detection. By accounting for the biological similarities among correlated AEs and addressing the excess of zero counts, this method more effectively disentangles AE associations. Statistical significance is evaluated using a permutation--based maximum statistic that preserves AE correlations within individual reports. Simulations and an application to real data from the Veneto drug safety database demonstrate that the ontology--based model consistently outperforms classical models such as the Gamma--Poisson Shrinker (GPS). For post--selection inference, we furthermore explore a data thinning technique for convolution--closed families, enabling the creation of independent training and validation datasets while retaining all drug--AE pairs. This approach is compared with conventional random train/test splitting, which may leave some drugs or AEs absent from one subset, and stratified splitting, which requires expanding aggregated counts into individual instances. The data--thinning technique and stratified splitting yield very similar results, with stratified splitting showing a slight benefit, and both clearly outperform random splitting in ensuring reliable and consistent model evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Leveraging on balance theory that deduces edge signs from multi-hop node pairs, signed graph learning can generate node embeddings that preserve both structural and sign information. However, training on sensitive signed graphs raises significant privacy concerns, as model parameters may leak private link information. Existing protection methods with differential privacy (DP) typically rely on edge or gradient perturbation for unsigned graph protection. Yet, they are not well-suited for signed graphs, mainly because edge perturbation tends to cascading errors in edge sign inference under balance theory, while gradient perturbation increases sensitivity due to node interdependence and gradient polarity change caused by sign flips, resulting in larger noise injection. In this paper, motivated by the robustness of adversarial learning to noisy interactions, we present ASGL, a privacy-preserving adversarial signed graph learning method that preserves high utility while achieving node-level DP. We first decompose signed graphs into positive and negative subgraphs based on edge signs, and then design a gradient-perturbed adversarial module to approximate the true signed connectivity distribution. In particular, the gradient perturbation helps mitigate cascading errors, while the subgraph separation facilitates sensitivity reduction. Further, we devise a constrained breadth-first search tree strategy that fuses with balance theory to identify the edge signs between generated node pairs. This strategy also enables gradient decoupling, thereby effectively lowering gradient sensitivity. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that ASGL achieves favorable privacy-utility trade-offs across multiple downstream tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SIGKDD 2026</p></details> |

Diffusion models are now widely used to train large, generalized policies that predict controls or trajectories, leveraging their ability to model multimodal action distributions. However, this generality comes at the cost of larger model sizes and slower inference, an acute limitation for robotic tasks requiring high control frequencies. Moreover, Diffusion Policy (DP), a popular trajectory-generation approach, suffers from a trade-off between performance and action horizon: fewer diffusion queries lead to larger trajectory chunks, which in turn accumulate tracking errors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce WARPD (World model Assisted Reactive Policy Diffusion), a method that generates closed-loop policies (weights for neural policies) directly, instead of open-loop trajectories. By learning behavioral distributions in parameter space rather than trajectory space, WARPD offers two major advantages: (1) extended action horizons with robustness to perturbations, while maintaining high task performance, and (2) significantly reduced inference costs. Empirically, WARPD outperforms DP in long-horizon and perturbed environments, and achieves multitask performance on par with DP while requiring only ~ 1/45th of the inference-time FLOPs per step.</p></details> | <details><summary>Outst...</summary><p>Outstanding Paper Award at the Embodied World Models for Decision Making Workshop at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Advancing Weakly-Supervised Change Detection in Satellite Images via Adversarial Class Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17186v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weakly-Supervised Change Detection (WSCD) aims to distinguish specific object changes (e.g., objects appearing or disappearing) from background variations (e.g., environmental changes due to light, weather, or seasonal shifts) in paired satellite images, relying only on paired image (i.e., image-level) classification labels. This technique significantly reduces the need for dense annotations required in fully-supervised change detection. However, as image-level supervision only indicates whether objects have changed in a scene, WSCD methods often misclassify background variations as object changes, especially in complex remote-sensing scenarios. In this work, we propose an Adversarial Class Prompting (AdvCP) method to address this co-occurring noise problem, including two phases: a) Adversarial Prompt Mining: After each training iteration, we introduce adversarial prompting perturbations, using incorrect one-hot image-level labels to activate erroneous feature mappings. This process reveals co-occurring adversarial samples under weak supervision, namely background variation features that are likely to be misclassified as object changes. b) Adversarial Sample Rectification: We integrate these adversarially prompt-activated pixel samples into training by constructing an online global prototype. This prototype is built from an exponentially weighted moving average of the current batch and all historical training data. Our AdvCP can be seamlessly integrated into current WSCD methods without adding additional inference cost. Experiments on ConvNet, Transformer, and Segment Anything Model (SAM)-based baselines demonstrate significant performance enhancements. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of AdvCP to other multi-class weakly-supervised dense prediction scenarios.

| **[Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning with Temporal Reasoning for Versatile Control of Video Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00996v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in text-to-video diffusion models have enabled high-quality video synthesis, but controllable generation remains challenging, particularly under limited data and compute. Existing fine-tuning methods for conditional generation often rely on external encoders or architectural modifications, which demand large datasets and are typically restricted to spatially aligned conditioning, limiting flexibility and scalability. In this work, we introduce Temporal In-Context Fine-Tuning (TIC-FT), an efficient and versatile approach for adapting pretrained video diffusion models to diverse conditional generation tasks. Our key idea is to concatenate condition and target frames along the temporal axis and insert intermediate buffer frames with progressively increasing noise levels. These buffer frames enable smooth transitions, aligning the fine-tuning process with the pretrained model's temporal dynamics. TIC-FT requires no architectural changes and achieves strong performance with as few as 10-30 training samples. We validate our method across a range of tasks, including image-to-video and video-to-video generation, using large-scale base models such as CogVideoX-5B and Wan-14B. Extensive experiments show that TIC-FT outperforms existing baselines in both condition fidelity and visual quality, while remaining highly efficient in both training and inference.

| **[The Final-Stage Bottleneck: A Systematic Dissection of the R-Learner for Network Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13018v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The R-Learner is a powerful, theoretically-grounded framework for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects, prized for its robustness to nuisance model errors. However, its application to network data, where causal heterogeneity is often graph-dependent, presents a critical challenge to its core assumption of a well-specified final-stage model. In this paper, we conduct a large-scale empirical study to systematically dissect the R-Learner framework on graphs. We provide the first rigorous evidence that the primary driver of performance is the inductive bias of the final-stage CATE estimator, an effect that dominates the choice of nuisance models. Our central finding is the quantification of a catastrophic "representation bottleneck": we prove with overwhelming statistical significance (p < 0.001) that R-Learners with a graph-blind final stage fail completely (MSE > 4.0), even when paired with powerful GNN nuisance models. Conversely, our proposed end-to-end Graph R-Learner succeeds and significantly outperforms a strong, non-DML GNN T-Learner baseline. Furthermore, we identify and provide a mechanistic explanation for a subtle, topology-dependent "nuisance bottleneck," linking it to GNN over-squashing via a targeted "Hub-Periphery Trade-off" analysis. Our findings are validated across diverse synthetic and semi-synthetic benchmarks. We release our code as a reproducible benchmark to facilitate future research on this critical "final-stage bottleneck."</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |
