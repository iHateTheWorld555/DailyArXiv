| **[ExposeAnyone: Personalized Audio-to-Expression Diffusion Models Are Robust Zero-Shot Face Forgery Detectors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02359v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting unknown deepfake manipulations remains one of the most challenging problems in face forgery detection. Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 11 tables; project page: https://mapooon.github.io/ExposeAnyonePage/</p></details> |
| **[VINO: A Unified Visual Generator with Interleaved OmniModal Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02358v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present VINO, a unified visual generator that performs image and video generation and editing within a single framework. Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sotamak1r.github.io/VINO-web/</p></details> |
| **[SpatialBench: Can Agents Analyze Real-World Spatial Biology Data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21907v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial transcriptomics assays are rapidly increasing in scale and complexity, making computational analysis a major bottleneck in biological discovery. Although frontier AI agents have improved dramatically at software engineering and general data analysis, it remains unclear whether they can extract biological insight from messy, real-world spatial datasets. We introduce SpatialBench, a benchmark of 146 verifiable problems derived from practical spatial analysis workflows spanning five spatial technologies and seven task categories. Each problem provides a snapshot of experimental data immediately prior to an analysis step and a deterministic grader that evaluates recovery of a key biological result. Benchmark data on frontier models shows that base model accuracy remains low (20-38% across model families), with strong model-task and model-platform interactions. Harness design has a large empirical effect on performance, indicating that tools, prompts, control flow, and execution environment should be evaluated and improved as first-class objects. SpatialBench serves both as a measurement tool and a diagnostic lens for developing agents that can interact with real spatial datasets faithfully, transparently, and reproducibly.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables; NeurIPS 2024 format</p></details> |
| **[Talk2Move: Reinforcement Learning for Text-Instructed Object-Level Geometric Transformation in Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02356v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Talk2Move, a reinforcement learning (RL) based diffusion framework for text-instructed spatial transformation of objects within scenes. Spatially manipulating objects in a scene through natural language poses a challenge for multimodal generation systems. While existing text-based manipulation methods can adjust appearance or style, they struggle to perform object-level geometric transformations-such as translating, rotating, or resizing objects-due to scarce paired supervision and pixel-level optimization limits. Talk2Move employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explore geometric actions through diverse rollouts generated from input images and lightweight textual variations, removing the need for costly paired data. A spatial reward guided model aligns geometric transformations with linguistic description, while off-policy step evaluation and active step sampling improve learning efficiency by focusing on informative transformation stages. Furthermore, we design object-centric spatial rewards that evaluate displacement, rotation, and scaling behaviors directly, enabling interpretable and coherent transformations. Experiments on curated benchmarks demonstrate that Talk2Move achieves precise, consistent, and semantically faithful object transformations, outperforming existing text-guided editing approaches in both spatial accuracy and scene coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sparkstj.github.io/talk2move</p></details> |
| **[Explainable AI Technique in Lung Cancer Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10196v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early detection of lung cancer is critical to improving survival outcomes. We present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes), we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152 achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast, accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in resource-limited settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Scaling Open-Ended Reasoning to Predict the Future](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25070v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-stakes decision making involves reasoning under uncertainty about the future. In this work, we train language models to make predictions on open-ended forecasting questions. To scale up training data, we synthesize novel forecasting questions from global events reported in daily news, using a fully automated, careful curation recipe. We train the Qwen3 thinking models on our dataset, OpenForesight. To prevent leakage of future information during training and evaluation, we use an offline news corpus, both for data generation and retrieval in our forecasting system. Guided by a small validation set, we show the benefits of retrieval, and an improved reward function for reinforcement learning (RL). Once we obtain our final forecasting system, we perform held-out testing between May to August 2025. Our specialized model, OpenForecaster 8B, matches much larger proprietary models, with our training improving the accuracy, calibration, and consistency of predictions. We find calibration improvements from forecasting training generalize across popular benchmarks. We open-source all our models, code, and data to make research on language model forecasting broadly accessible.</p></details> | 45 pages |

However, these methods often treat the semantic and rendering branches separately, relying solely on 2D supervision while ignoring the 3D Gaussian geometry. Moreover, current adaptive strategies adapt the Gaussian set depending solely on rendering gradients, which can be insufficient in subtle or textureless regions. In this work, we propose a joint enhancement framework for 3D semantic Gaussian modeling that synergizes both semantic and rendering branches. Firstly, unlike conventional point cloud shape encoding, we introduce an anisotropic 3D Gaussian Chebyshev descriptor using the Laplace-Beltrami operator to capture fine-grained 3D shape details, thereby distinguishing objects with similar appearances and reducing reliance on potentially noisy 2D guidance. In addition, without relying solely on rendering gradient, we adaptively adjust Gaussian allocation and spherical harmonics with local semantic and shape signals, enhancing rendering efficiency through selective resource allocation. Finally, we employ a cross-scene knowledge transfer module to continuously update learned shape patterns, enabling faster convergence and robust representations without relearning shape information from scratch for each new scene. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate improvements in segmentation accuracy and rendering quality while maintaining high rendering frame rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICCV 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vision-Language Reasoning for Geolocalization: A Reinforcement Learning Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00388v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in vision-language models have opened up new possibilities for reasoning-driven image geolocalization. However, existing approaches often rely on synthetic reasoning annotations or external image retrieval, which can limit interpretability and generalizability. In this paper, we present Geo-R, a retrieval-free framework that uncovers structured reasoning paths from existing ground-truth coordinates and optimizes geolocation accuracy via reinforcement learning. We propose the Chain of Region, a rule-based hierarchical reasoning paradigm that generates precise, interpretable supervision by mapping GPS coordinates to geographic entities (e.g., country, province, city) without relying on model-generated or synthetic labels. Building on this, we introduce a lightweight reinforcement learning strategy with coordinate-aligned rewards based on Haversine distance, enabling the model to refine predictions through spatially meaningful feedback. Our approach bridges structured geographic reasoning with direct spatial supervision, yielding improved localization accuracy, stronger generalization, and more transparent inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of Geo-R, establishing a new retrieval-free paradigm for scalable and interpretable image geolocalization. To facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, both the model and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[BEDS: Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02329v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present BEDS (Bayesian Emergent Dissipative Structures), a theoretical framework that unifies concepts from non-equilibrium thermodynamics, Bayesian inference, information geometry, and machine learning. The central thesis proposes that learning, across physical, biological, and computational systems, fundamentally constitutes the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, we establish a formal isomorphism between thermodynamic processes and Bayesian updating, demonstrating that sustainable learning systems must follow dissipative patterns where crystallized posteriors become priors for subsequent levels of emergence. We derive fundamental mathematical constants (e, π, φ) as fixed points of Bayesian inference under minimal axioms, suggesting these constants emerge necessarily from any system capable of representing and updating uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture linking Gödel's incompleteness theorems to thermodynamic constraints, hypothesizing that pathologies of formal systems (incompleteness, undecidability) are structurally analogous to dissipation deficits in physical systems. As practical validation, we present a peer-to-peer network architecture implementing BEDS principles, achieving six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing distributed consensus systems while enabling continuous learning. This work bridges fundamental physics, mathematical logic, and practical system design, offering both theoretical insights into the nature of learning and computation, and a concrete pathway toward sustainable artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Fusion2Print: Deep Flash-Non-Flash Fusion for Contactless Fingerprint Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02318v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Contactless fingerprint recognition offers a hygienic and convenient alternative to contact-based systems, enabling rapid acquisition without latent prints, pressure artifacts, or hygiene risks. However, contactless images often show degraded ridge clarity due to illumination variation, subcutaneous skin discoloration, and specular reflections. Flash captures preserve ridge detail but introduce noise, whereas non-flash captures reduce noise but lower ridge contrast. We propose Fusion2Print (F2P), the first framework to systematically capture and fuse paired flash-non-flash contactless fingerprints. We construct a custom paired dataset, FNF Database, and perform manual flash-non-flash subtraction to isolate ridge-preserving signals. A lightweight attention-based fusion network also integrates both modalities, emphasizing informative channels and suppressing noise, and then a U-Net enhancement module produces an optimally weighted grayscale image. Finally, a deep embedding model with cross-domain compatibility, generates discriminative and robust representations in a unified embedding space compatible with both contactless and contact-based fingerprints for verification. F2P enhances ridge clarity and achieves superior recognition performance (AUC=0.999, EER=1.12%) over single-capture baselines (Verifinger, DeepPrint).</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures, 5 tables.

| **[Prithvi-Complimentary Adaptive Fusion Encoder (CAFE): unlocking full-potential for flood inundation mapping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02315v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geo-Foundation Models (GFMs), have proven effective in diverse downstream applications, including semantic segmentation, classification, and regression tasks. However, in case of flood mapping using Sen1Flood11 dataset as a downstream task, GFMs struggles to outperform the baseline U-Net, highlighting model's limitation in capturing critical local nuances. To address this, we present the Prithvi-Complementary Adaptive Fusion Encoder (CAFE), which integrate Prithvi GFM pretrained encoder with a parallel CNN residual branch enhanced by Convolutional Attention Modules (CAM). Prithvi-CAFE enables fast and efficient fine-tuning through adapters in Prithvi and performs multi-scale, multi-level fusion with CNN features, capturing critical local details while preserving long-range dependencies. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two comprehensive flood mapping datasets: Sen1Flood11 and FloodPlanet. On Sen1Flood11 test data, Prithvi-CAFE (IoU 83.41) outperforms the original Prithvi (IoU 82.50) and other major GFMs (TerraMind 82.90, DOFA 81.54, spectralGPT: 81.02). The improvement is even more pronounced on the hold-out test site, where Prithvi-CAFE achieves an IoU of 81.37 compared to the baseline U-Net (70.57) and original Prithvi (72.42). On FloodPlanet, Prithvi-CAFE also surpasses the baseline U-Net and other GFMs, achieving an IoU of 64.70 compared to U-Net (60.14), Terramind (62.33), DOFA (59.15) and Prithvi 2.0 (61.91). Our proposed simple yet effective Prithvi-CAFE demonstrates strong potential for improving segmentation tasks where multi-channel and multi-modal data provide complementary information and local details are critical. The code is released on \href{https://github.com/Sk-2103/Prithvi-CAFE}{Prithvi-CAFE Github}</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CV4EO Workshop @ WACV 2026</p></details> |

Prior work has established bounds on the success of backdoor attacks and their impact on the benign learning task, however, an open question is what amount of poison data is needed for a successful backdoor attack. Typical attacks either use few samples but need much information about the data points, or need to poison many data points. In this paper, we formulate the one-poison hypothesis: An adversary with one poison sample and limited background knowledge can inject a backdoor with zero backdooring-error and without significantly impacting the benign learning task performance. Moreover, we prove the one-poison hypothesis for linear regression, linear classification, and 2-layer ReLU neural networks. For adversaries that utilize a direction unused by the clean data distribution for the poison sample, we prove for linear classification and linear regression that the resulting model is functionally equivalent to a model where the poison was excluded from training. We build on prior work on statistical backdoor learning to show that in all other cases, the impact on the benign learning task is still limited. We validate our theoretical results experimentally with realistic benchmark data sets.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added generalization to 2-layer ReLU neural networks</p></details> |

However, these systems are prone to inaccurate, fictitious, or harmful responses, and their vast, high-dimensional input space makes systematic testing particularly challenging. To address this, we present STELLAR, an automated search-based testing framework for LLM-based applications that systematically uncovers text inputs leading to inappropriate system responses. Our framework models test generation as an optimization problem and discretizes the input space into stylistic, content-related, and perturbation features. Unlike prior work that focuses on prompt optimization or coverage heuristics, our work employs evolutionary optimization to dynamically explore feature combinations that are more likely to expose failures. We evaluate STELLAR on three LLM-based conversational question-answering systems. The first focuses on safety, benchmarking both public and proprietary LLMs against malicious or unsafe prompts. The second and third target navigation, using an open-source and an industrial retrieval-augmented system for in-vehicle venue recommendations. Overall, STELLAR exposes up to 4.3 times (average 2.5 times) more failures than the existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 33th International Conference on Software Analysis, Evolution and Reengineering (SANER 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Placement Semantics for Distributed Deep Learning: A Systematic Framework for Analyzing Parallelism Strategies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02311v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models requires distributing computation across many accelerators, yet practitioners select parallelism strategies (data, tensor, pipeline, ZeRO) through trial and error because no unified systematic framework predicts their behavior. We introduce placement semantics: each strategy is specified by how it places four training states (parameters, optimizer, gradients, activations) across devices using five modes (replicated, sharded, sharded-with-gather, materialized, offloaded). From placement alone, without implementation details, we derive memory consumption and communication volume. Our predictions match published results exactly: ZeRO-3 uses 8x less memory than data parallelism at 1.5x communication cost, as reported in the original paper. We prove two conditions (gradient integrity, state consistency) are necessary and sufficient for distributed training to match single-device results, and provide composition rules for combining strategies safely. The framework unifies ZeRO Stages 1-3, Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP), tensor parallelism, and pipeline parallelism as instances with different placement choices.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 tables |

Understanding how affected populations perceive and respond during wildfire crises is critical for timely and empathetic disaster response. Social media platforms offer a crowd-sourced channel to capture evolving public discourse, providing hyperlocal information and insight into public sentiment. This study analyzes Reddit discourse during the 2025 Los Angeles wildfires, spanning from the onset of the disaster to full containment. We collect 385 posts and 114,879 comments related to the Palisades and Eaton fires. We adopt topic modeling methods to identify the latent topics, enhanced by large language models (LLMs) and human-in-the-loop (HITL) refinement. Furthermore, we develop a hierarchical framework to categorize latent topics, consisting of two main categories, Situational Awareness (SA) and Crisis Narratives (CN). The volume of SA category closely aligns with real-world fire progressions, peaking within the first 2-5 days as the fires reach the maximum extent. The most frequent co-occurring category set of public health and safety, loss and damage, and emergency resources expands on a wide range of health-related latent topics, including environmental health, occupational health, and one health. Grief signals and mental health risks consistently accounted for 60 percentage and 40 percentage of CN instances, respectively, with the highest total volume occurring at night. This study contributes the first annotated social media dataset on the 2025 LA fires, and introduces a scalable multi-layer framework that leverages topic modeling for crisis discourse analysis. By identifying persistent public health concerns, our results can inform more empathetic and adaptive strategies for disaster response, public health communication, and future research in comparable climate-related disaster events.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fix t...</summary><p>Fix typos in Method Section.

Alpha decay represents a significant challenge, with traditional models such as DeepLOB losing predictive power as the time horizon (k) increases. In this paper, using data from the FI-2010 dataset, we introduce Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (T-KAN) to replace the fixed, linear weights of standard LSTMs with learnable B-spline activation functions. This allows the model to learn the 'shape' of market signals as opposed to just their magnitude. This resulted in a 19.1% relative improvement in the F1-score at the k = 100 horizon. The efficacy of T-KAN networks cannot be understated, producing a 132.48% return compared to the -82.76% DeepLOB drawdown under 1.0 bps transaction costs. In addition to this, the T-KAN model proves quite interpretable, with the 'dead-zones' being clearly visible in the splines. The T-KAN architecture is also uniquely optimized for low-latency FPGA implementation via High level Synthesis (HLS).

| **[Differential Privacy for Transformer Embeddings of Text with Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02307v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a privacy-preserving method for sharing text data by sharing noisy versions of their transformer embeddings. It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with Rényi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. With lower noise levels, our model maintains high accuracy while offering strong privacy guarantees, effectively balancing privacy and utility.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

Our approach addresses key challenges in personalization and cold-start initialization, particularly for new advertising objectives. By leveraging transfer learning from large-scale ad and content interactions within a multi-task learning (MTL) framework, a single joint model can be fine-tuned or directly applied to new or low-data targeting tasks, including in-app promotions. This multi-objective design jointly optimizes podcast outcomes such as streams, clicks, and follows for both ads and promotions using a shared representation over user, content, context, and creative features, effectively supporting diverse business goals while improving user experience. Online A/B tests show up to a 22% reduction in effective Cost-Per-Stream (eCPS), particularly for less-streamed podcasts, and an 18-24% increase in podcast stream rates. Offline experiments and ablations highlight the contribution of ancillary objectives and feature groups to cold-start performance. Our experience shows that a unified modeling strategy improves maintainability, cold-start performance, and coverage, while breaking down historically siloed targeting pipelines. We discuss practical trade-offs of such joint models in a real-world advertising system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at WSDM 2026</p></details> |
| **[Grounded Test-Time Adaptation for LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04847v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to generalize to novel and complex environments, such as unseen websites or new sets of functions, due to a fundamental mismatch between their pre-training and test-time conditions. This challenge stems from two distinct failure modes: a syntactic misunderstanding of environment-specific components like observation formats, and a semantic misunderstanding of state-transition dynamics, which are only revealed at test time. To address these issues, we propose two distinct and complementary strategies for adapting LLM agents by leveraging environment-specific information available during deployment. First, an online distributional adaptation method parameterizes environmental nuances by learning a lightweight adaptation vector that biases the model's output distribution, enabling rapid alignment with an environment response format. Second, a deployment-time dynamics grounding method employs a persona-driven exploration phase to systematically probe and learn the environment's causal dynamics before task execution, equipping the agent with a nonparametric world model. We evaluate these strategies across diverse agentic benchmarks, including function calling and web navigation. Our empirical results show the effectiveness of both strategies across all benchmarks with minimal computational cost. We find that dynamics grounding is particularly effective in complex environments where unpredictable dynamics pose a major obstacle, demonstrating a robust path toward more generalizable and capable LLM-based agents. For example, on the WebArena multi-site split, this method increases the agent's success rate from 2% to 23%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code is available here: https://github.com/r2llab/GTTA</p></details> |

It is well known that the effectiveness of such methods depends crucially on the relative correlations and computational costs of the available computational models. However, the question of how to automatically tune low-fidelity models to maximize performance remains an open area of research. This work investigates automated model tuning, which optimizes model hyperparameters to minimize estimator variance within a target computational budget. Focusing on multifidelity trajectory simulation estimators, the cost-versus-precision tradeoff enabled by this approach is demonstrated in a practical, online setting where upfront tuning costs cannot be amortized. Using a real-world entry, descent, and landing example, it is shown that automated model tuning largely outperforms hand-tuned models even when the overall computational budget is relatively low. Furthermore, for scenarios where the computational budget is large, model tuning solutions can approach the best-case multifidelity estimator performance where optimal model hyperparameters are known a priori. Recommendations for applying model tuning in practice are provided and avenues for enabling adoption of such approaches for budget-constrained problems are highlighted.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages with 15 figures in main text</p></details> |

Site-specific beamforming (SSBF) has emerged as a promising paradigm to mitigate the channel acquisition bottleneck in multiantenna systems by exploiting environmental priors. However, classical SSBF based on discriminative deep learning struggles: 1) to properly represent the inherent multimodality of wireless propagation and 2) to effectively capture the structural features of beamformers. In contrast, by leveraging conditional generative models, GenSSBF addresses these issues via learning a conditional distribution over feasible beamformers. By doing so, the synthesis of diverse and high-fidelity beam candidates from coarse channel sensing measurements can be guaranteed. This article presents the fundamentals, system designs, and implementation methods of GenSSBF. Case studies in both indoor and outdoor scenarios show that GenSSBF attains near-optimal beamforming gain with ultra-low channel acquisition overhead. Finally, several open research problems are highlighted.</p></details> | 7 pages, 5 figures |

Manual waste sorting is a common practice; however, it remains inefficient for handling large-scale waste streams and presents health risks for workers. On the other hand, existing automated sorting approaches still struggle with the high variability, clutter, and visual complexity of real-world waste streams. The lack of real-world datasets for waste sorting is a major reason automated systems for this problem are underdeveloped. Accordingly, we introduce SortWaste, a densely annotated object detection dataset collected from a Material Recovery Facility. Additionally, we contribute to standardizing waste detection in sorting lines by proposing ClutterScore, an objective metric that gauges the scene's hardness level using a set of proxies that affect visual complexity (e.g., object count, class and size entropy, and spatial overlap). In addition to these contributions, we provide an extensive benchmark of state-of-the-art object detection models, detailing their results with respect to the hardness level assessed by the proposed metric. Despite achieving promising results (mAP of 59.7% in the plastic-only detection task), performance significantly decreases in highly cluttered scenes. This highlights the need for novel and more challenging datasets on the topic.</p></details> | 9 pages |

This work introduces CycleVLA, a system that equips Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) with proactive self-correction, the capability to anticipate incipient failures and recover before they fully manifest during execution. CycleVLA achieves this by integrating a progress-aware VLA that flags critical subtask transition points where failures most frequently occur, a VLM-based failure predictor and planner that triggers subtask backtracking upon predicted failure, and a test-time scaling strategy based on Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to improve retry success after backtracking. Extensive experiments show that CycleVLA improves performance for both well-trained and under-trained VLAs, and that MBR serves as an effective zero-shot test-time scaling strategy for VLAs.

It is essential to have tools that help analyze large volumes of stored traffic data and make effective interventions. To address this need, we present ``BigSUMO", an end-to-end, scalable, open-source framework for analytics, interruption detection, and parallel traffic simulation. Our system ingests high-resolution loop detector and signal state data, along with sparse probe trajectory data. It first performs descriptive analytics and detects potential interruptions. It then uses the SUMO microsimulator for prescriptive analytics, testing hundreds of what-if scenarios to optimize traffic performance. The modular design allows integration of different algorithms for data processing and outlier detection. Built using open-source software and libraries, the pipeline is cost-effective, scalable, and easy to deploy. We hope BigSUMO will be a valuable aid in developing smart city mobility solutions.</p></details> | 6 pages, 10 figures |

However, advances in generative machine learning prompt an interesting new, non-i.i.d. setting: after receiving a certain number of samples, an estimated distribution is fixed, and samples from this estimate are drawn and introduced into the sample corpus, undifferentiated from real samples. Subsequent generations of estimators now face contaminated environments, a scenario referred to in the machine learning literature as self-consumption. Empirically, it has been observed that models in fully synthetic self-consuming loops collapse -- their performance deteriorates with each batch of training -- but accumulating data has been shown to prevent complete degeneration. This, in turn, begs the question: What happens when fresh real samples \textit{are} added at every stage? In this paper, we study the minimax loss of self-consuming discrete distribution estimation in such loops. We show that even when model collapse is consciously averted, the ratios between the minimax losses with and without source information can grow unbounded as the batch size increases. In the data accumulation setting, where all batches of samples are available for estimation, we provide minimax lower bounds and upper bounds that are order-optimal under mild conditions for the expected $\ell_2^2$ and $\ell_1$ losses at every stage. We provide conditions for regimes where there is a strict gap in the convergence rates compared to the corresponding oracle-assisted minimax loss where real and synthetic samples are differentiated, and provide examples where this gap is easily observed. We also provide a lower bound on the minimax loss in the data replacement setting, where only the latest batch of samples is available, and use it to find a lower bound for the worst-case loss for bounded estimate trajectories.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figures; shorter version presented at IEEE ISIT 2025; accepted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

Evaluating the Quality of LLM-Generated Algebraic Specifications: A Case Study in Optimization at Kinaxis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.00469v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model-driven engineering (MDE) provides abstraction and analytical rigour, but industrial adoption in many domains has been limited by the cost of developing and maintaining models. Large language models (LLMs) can help shift this cost balance by supporting direct generation of models from natural-language (NL) descriptions. For domain-specific languages (DSLs), however, LLM-generated models may be less accurate than LLM-generated code in mainstream languages such as Python, due to the latter's dominance in LLM training corpora. We investigate this issue in mathematical optimization, with AMPL, a DSL with established industrial use. We introduce EXEOS, an LLM-based approach that derives AMPL models and Python code from NL problem descriptions and iteratively refines them with solver feedback. Using a public optimization dataset and real-world supply-chain cases from our industrial partner Kinaxis, we evaluate generated AMPL models against Python code in terms of executability and correctness. An ablation study with two LLM families shows that AMPL is competitive with, and sometimes better than, Python, and that our design choices in EXEOS improve the quality of generated specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ICSE-SEIP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Machine Learning Guided Cooling Optimization for Data Centers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02275v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective data center cooling is crucial for reliable operation; however, cooling systems often exhibit inefficiencies that result in excessive energy consumption. This paper presents a three-stage, physics-guided machine learning framework for identifying and reducing cooling energy waste in high-performance computing facilities. Using one year of 10-minute resolution operational data from the Frontier exascale supercomputer, we first train a monotonicity-constrained gradient boosting surrogate that predicts facility accessory power from coolant flow rates, temperatures, and server power. The surrogate achieves a mean absolute error of 0.026 MW and predicts power usage effectiveness within 0.01 of measured values for 98.7% of test samples. In the second stage, the surrogate serves as a physics-consistent baseline to quantify excess cooling energy, revealing approximately 85 MWh of annual inefficiency concentrated in specific months, hours, and operating regimes. The third stage evaluates guardrail-constrained counterfactual adjustments to supply temperature and subloop flows, demonstrating that up to 96% of identified excess can be recovered through small, safe setpoint changes while respecting thermal limits and operational constraints. The framework yields interpretable recommendations, supports counterfactual analyses such as flow reduction during low-load periods and redistribution of thermal duty across cooling loops, and provides a practical pathway toward quantifiable reductions in accessory power. The developed framework is readily compatible with model predictive control and can be extended to other liquid-cooled data centers with different configurations and cooling requirements.</p></details> | 10 pages, 11 figures |

In this paper, we propose DiffProxy, a novel framework that generates multi-view consistent human proxies for mesh recovery. Central to DiffProxy is leveraging the diffusion-based generative priors to bridge the synthetic training and real-world generalization. Its key innovations include: (1) a multi-conditional mechanism for generating multi-view consistent, pixel-aligned human proxies; (2) a hand refinement module that incorporates flexible visual prompts to enhance local details; and (3) an uncertainty-aware test-time scaling method that increases robustness to challenging cases during optimization. These designs ensure that the mesh recovery process effectively benefits from the precise synthetic ground truth and generative advantages of the diffusion-based pipeline. Trained entirely on synthetic data, DiffProxy achieves state-of-the-art performance across five real-world benchmarks, demonstrating strong zero-shot generalization particularly on challenging scenarios with occlusions and partial views.

We introduce POSEIDON (Physics-Optimized Seismic Energy Inference and Detection Operating Network), a physics-informed energy-based model for unified multi-task seismic event prediction, alongside the Poseidon dataset -- the largest open-source global earthquake catalog comprising 2.8 million events spanning 30 years. POSEIDON embeds fundamental seismological principles, including the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency relationship and Omori-Utsu aftershock decay law, as learnable constraints within an energy-based modeling framework. The architecture simultaneously addresses three interconnected prediction tasks: aftershock sequence identification, tsunami generation potential, and foreshock detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POSEIDON achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, outperforming gradient boosting, random forest, and CNN baselines with the highest average F1 score among all compared methods. Crucially, the learned physics parameters converge to scientifically interpretable values -- Gutenberg-Richter b-value of 0.752 and Omori-Utsu parameters p=0.835, c=0.1948 days -- falling within established seismological ranges while enhancing rather than compromising predictive accuracy. The Poseidon dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BorisKriuk/Poseidon, providing pre-computed energy features, spatial grid indices, and standardized quality metrics to advance physics-informed seismic research.</p></details> | 8 pages, 14 figures |

However, the fairness implications of this new paradigm remain largely unexplored. We present the first investigation of fairness in tabular ICL, evaluating three recently proposed foundation models--TabPFNv2, TabICL, and TabDPT--on multiple benchmark datasets. To mitigate biases, we explore three pre-processing fairness-enhancing methods: correlation removal (decorrelating input features from the sensitive attribute), group-balanced sample selection (ensuring equal representation of protected groups in context examples), and uncertainty-based sample selection (prioritizing context examples with high sensitive-attribute prediction uncertainty). Our experiments show that the uncertainty-based strategy consistently improves group fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity, equalized odds, and equal opportunity) with minimal impact on predictive accuracy.

Current state-of-the-art approaches fail to generalize to unseen manipulations, as they primarily rely on supervised training with existing deepfakes or pseudo-fakes, which leads to overfitting to specific forgery patterns. In contrast, self-supervised methods offer greater potential for generalization, but existing work struggles to learn discriminative representations only from self-supervision. In this paper, we propose ExposeAnyone, a fully self-supervised approach based on a diffusion model that generates expression sequences from audio. The key idea is, once the model is personalized to specific subjects using reference sets, it can compute the identity distances between suspected videos and personalized subjects via diffusion reconstruction errors, enabling person-of-interest face forgery detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 1) our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 4.22 percentage points in the average AUC on DF-TIMIT, DFDCP, KoDF, and IDForge datasets, 2) our model is also capable of detecting Sora2-generated videos, where the previous approaches perform poorly, and 3) our method is highly robust to corruptions such as blur and compression, highlighting the applicability in real-world face forgery detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 8 figures, 11 tables; project page: https://mapooon.github.io/ExposeAnyonePage/</p></details> |

Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sotamak1r.github.io/VINO-web/</p></details> |

Spatially manipulating objects in a scene through natural language poses a challenge for multimodal generation systems. While existing text-based manipulation methods can adjust appearance or style, they struggle to perform object-level geometric transformations-such as translating, rotating, or resizing objects-due to scarce paired supervision and pixel-level optimization limits. Talk2Move employs Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to explore geometric actions through diverse rollouts generated from input images and lightweight textual variations, removing the need for costly paired data. A spatial reward guided model aligns geometric transformations with linguistic description, while off-policy step evaluation and active step sampling improve learning efficiency by focusing on informative transformation stages. Furthermore, we design object-centric spatial rewards that evaluate displacement, rotation, and scaling behaviors directly, enabling interpretable and coherent transformations. Experiments on curated benchmarks demonstrate that Talk2Move achieves precise, consistent, and semantically faithful object transformations, outperforming existing text-guided editing approaches in both spatial accuracy and scene coherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sparkstj.github.io/talk2move</p></details> |
| **[Differential Privacy for Transformer Embeddings of Text with Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02307v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a privacy-preserving method for sharing text data by sharing noisy versions of their transformer embeddings. It has been shown that hidden representations learned by deep models can encode sensitive information from the input, making it possible for adversaries to recover the input data with considerable accuracy. This problem is exacerbated in transformer embeddings because they consist of multiple vectors, one per token. To mitigate this risk, we propose Nonparametric Variational Differential Privacy (NVDP), which ensures both useful data sharing and strong privacy protection. We take a differential privacy approach, integrating a Nonparametric Variational Information Bottleneck (NVIB) layer into the transformer architecture to inject noise into its multi-vector embeddings and thereby hide information, and measuring privacy protection with Rényi divergence and its corresponding Bayesian Differential Privacy (BDP) guarantee. Training the NVIB layer calibrates the noise level according to utility. We test NVDP on the GLUE benchmark and show that varying the noise level gives us a useful tradeoff between privacy and accuracy. With lower noise levels, our model maintains high accuracy while offering strong privacy guarantees, effectively balancing privacy and utility.</p></details> | 11 pages, 2 figures |

We present a general elimination principle based on dinaturality for directed equality which very closely resembles the $J$-rule used in Martin-Löf type theory, and we highlight which syntactical restrictions are needed to interpret this rule in the context of directed equality. We then use these rules to characterize directed equality as a left relative adjoint to a functor between (para)categories of dinatural transformations which contracts together two variables appearing naturally with a single dinatural one, with the relative functor imposing the syntactic restrictions needed. We then argue that the quantifiers of such a directed type theory should be interpreted as ends and coends, which dinaturality allows us to present in adjoint-like correspondences to a weakening functor. Using these rules we give a formal interpretation to Yoneda reductions and (co)end calculus, and we use logical derivations to prove the Fubini rule for quantifier exchange, the adjointness property of Kan extensions via (co)ends, exponential objects of presheaves, and the (co)Yoneda lemma. We show transitivity (composition), congruence (functoriality), and transport (coYoneda) for directed equality by closely following the same approach of Martin-Löf type theory, with the notable exception of symmetry. We formalize our main theorems in Agda.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, POPL 2026. Extended version with Appendix.

SER programs are suitably restricted to make this problem decidable, while still allowing for an unbounded number of concurrent threads of execution, each potentially running for an unbounded number of steps. Building on prior theoretical results, we give the first automated end-to-end decision procedure that either proves serializability by producing a checkable certificate, or refutes it by producing a counterexample trace. We also present a network-system abstraction to which SER programs compile. Our decision procedure then reduces serializability in this setting to a Petri net reachability query. Furthermore, in order to scale, we curtail the search space via multiple optimizations, including Petri net slicing, semilinear-set compression, and Presburger-formula manipulation. We extensively evaluate our framework and show that, despite the theoretical hardness of the problem, it can successfully handle various models of real-world programs, including stateful firewalls, BGP routers, and more.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in TACAS 2026</p></details> |

In this study we investigates the potential of hybrid quantum-classical learning to enhance feature representations for intrusion detection and explore possible quantum advantages in cybersecurity analytics. Using the UNSW-NB15 dataset, network traffic is transformed into structured feature vectors through classical preprocessing and normalization. Classical models, including Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines with linear and RBF kernels, are evaluated on the full dataset to establish baseline performance under large-sample conditions. Simultaneously, a quantum-enhanced pipeline maps classical features into variational quantum circuits via angle encoding and entangling layers, executed on a CPU-based quantum simulator, with resulting quantum embeddings classified using a classical SVM. Experiments show that while classical models achieve higher overall accuracy with large datasets, quantum-enhanced representations demonstrate superior attack recall and improved class separability when data is scarce, suggesting that quantum feature spaces capture complex correlations inaccessible to shallow classical models. These results highlight the potential of quantum embeddings to improve generalization and representation quality in cybersecurity tasks and provide a reproducible framework for evaluating quantum advantages as quantum hardware and simulators continue to advance.</p></details> | 12 pages, 4 figures |

To understand the internal mechanism of MMDiT-based models, existing methods tried to analyze the effect of specific components like positional encoding and attention layers. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms various baselines and remains flexible across text-to-image generation, image editing, and inference acceleration. Our method improves T2I-Combench++ from 56.92% to 63.00% and GenEval from 66.42% to 71.63% on SD3.5, without sacrificing synthesis quality. These results advance understanding of MMDiT models and provide valuable insights to unlock new possibilities for further improvements.</p></details> | 11 pages |

As robots increasingly act as interpersonal communication channels in care, education, and telepresence, they convey not only speech but also gesture, emotion, and contextual cues. We argue that extending digital surveillance laws to such embodied systems would entail continuous monitoring, embedding observation into the very design of everyday robots. This regulation blurs the line between protection and control, turning companions into potential informants. At the same time, monitoring mechanisms that undermine end-to-end encryption function as de facto backdoors, expanding the attack surface and allowing adversaries to exploit legally induced monitoring infrastructures. This creates a paradox of safety through insecurity: systems introduced to protect users may instead compromise their privacy, autonomy, and trust. This work does not aim to predict the future, but to raise awareness and help prevent certain futures from materialising.</p></details> | 15 pages, 2 figures |

By leveraging a unified vision representation within a unified autoregressive architecture, NextFlow natively activates multimodal understanding and generation capabilities, unlocking abilities of image editing, interleaved content and video generation. Motivated by the distinct nature of modalities - where text is strictly sequential and images are inherently hierarchical - we retain next-token prediction for text but adopt next-scale prediction for visual generation. This departs from traditional raster-scan methods, enabling the generation of 1024x1024 images in just 5 seconds - orders of magnitude faster than comparable AR models. We address the instabilities of multi-scale generation through a robust training recipe. Furthermore, we introduce a prefix-tuning strategy for reinforcement learning. Experiments demonstrate that NextFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance among unified models and rivals specialized diffusion baselines in visual quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/ByteVisionLab/NextFlow</p></details> |
| **[Toward Global Large Language Models in Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02186v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite continuous advances in medical technology, the global distribution of health care resources remains uneven. The development of large language models (LLMs) has transformed the landscape of medicine and holds promise for improving health care quality and expanding access to medical information globally. However, existing LLMs are primarily trained on high-resource languages, limiting their applicability in global medical scenarios. To address this gap, we constructed GlobMed, a large multilingual medical dataset, containing over 500,000 entries spanning 12 languages, including four low-resource languages. Building on this, we established GlobMed-Bench, which systematically assesses 56 state-of-the-art proprietary and open-weight LLMs across multiple multilingual medical tasks, revealing significant performance disparities across languages, particularly for low-resource languages. Additionally, we introduced GlobMed-LLMs, a suite of multilingual medical LLMs trained on GlobMed, with parameters ranging from 1.7B to 8B. GlobMed-LLMs achieved an average performance improvement of over 40% relative to baseline models, with a more than threefold increase in performance on low-resource languages. Together, these resources provide an important foundation for advancing the equitable development and application of LLMs globally, enabling broader language communities to benefit from technological advances.</p></details> | <details><summary>182 p...</summary><p>182 pages, 65 figures</p></details> |
| **[Investigating the Robustness of Extreme Precipitation Super-Resolution Across Climates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09166v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The coarse spatial resolution of gridded climate models, such as general circulation models, limits their direct use in projecting socially relevant variables like extreme precipitation. Most downscaling methods estimate the conditional distributions of extremes by generating large ensembles, complicating the assessment of robustness under distributional transformations, such as those induced by climate change. To better understand and potentially improve robustness, we propose super-resolving the parameters of the target variable's probability distribution directly using analytically tractable mappings. Within a perfect-model framework over Switzerland, we demonstrate that vector generalized linear and additive models can super-resolve the generalized extreme value distribution of summer hourly precipitation extremes from coarse precipitation fields and topography. We introduce the notion of a "robustness gap", defined as the difference in predictive error between present-trained and future-trained models, and use it to diagnose how model structure affects the generalization of each quantile to a pseudo-global warming scenario. By evaluating multiple model configurations, we also identify an upper limit on the super-resolution factor based on the spatial auto- and cross-correlation of precipitation and elevation, beyond which coarse precipitation loses predictive value. Our framework is broadly applicable to variables governed by parametric distributions and offers a model-agnostic diagnostic for understanding when and why empirical downscaling generalizes to climate change and extremes.</p></details> | <details><summary>47+7 ...</summary><p>47+7 pages, 10+4 figures, 1 table, submitted to WCE</p></details> |

The model is trained in an unsupervised manner on synthetic data in the form of conductance maps, using a physics-informed loss that incorporates key properties of Majorana zero modes. We show that, with appropriate training, a deep vision-transformer network can efficiently memorize relation between Hamiltonian parameters and structures on conductance maps and use it to propose parameters update for a quantum dot chain that drive the system toward topological phase. Starting from a broad range of initial detunings in parameter space, a single update step is sufficient to generate nontrivial zero modes. Moreover, by enabling an iterative tuning procedure - where the system acquires updated conductance maps at each step - we demonstrate that the method can address a much larger region of the parameter space.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main file: 8 pages, 6 figures; supplementary: 3 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Gibbs randomness-compression proposition: An efficient deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23869v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A proposition that connects randomness and compression is put forward via Gibbs entropy over set of measurement vectors associated with a compression process. The proposition states that a lossy compression process is equivalent to {\it directed randomness} that preserves information content. The proposition originated from the observed behavior in newly proposed {\it Dual Tomographic Compression} (DTC) compress-train framework. This is akin to tomographic reconstruction of layer weight matrices via building compressed sensed projections, via so-called {\it weight rays}. This tomographic approach is applied to previous and next layers in a dual fashion, that triggers neuronal-level pruning. This novel model compress-train scheme appears in iterative fashion and acts as a smart neural architecture search: also called {\it compression aware training}. The experiments demonstrated the utility of this dual-tomography during training: method accelerates and supports lottery ticket hypothesis. However, random compress-train iterations having similar performance demonstrated the connection between randomness and compression from statistical physics perspective, we formulated the so-called {\it Gibbs randomness-compression proposition}, signifying randomness-compression relationship via Gibbs entropy. The proposition is supported with the experimental evidence, resulting in very high correlation between learning performance vs. Gibbs entropy over compression ratios. Practically, the DTC framework provides a promising approach for massively energy- and resource-efficient deep learning training.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 1 table, 1 algorithm, 1 theorem</p></details> |
| **[A Universal and Robust Framework for Multiple Gas Recognition Based-on Spherical Normalization-Coupled Mahalanobis Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22792v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electronic nose (E-nose) systems face two interconnected challenges in open-set gas recognition: feature distribution shift caused by signal drift and decision boundary failure induced by unknown gas interference. Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance or conventional classifiers, failing to account for anisotropic feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes the Spherical Normalization coupled Mahalanobis (SNM) module, a universal post-processing module for open-set gas recognition. First, it achieves geometric decoupling through cascaded batch and L2 normalization, projecting features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Second, it utilizes Mahalanobis distance to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries that conform to the anisotropic feature geometry. The architecture-agnostic SNM-Module seamlessly integrates with mainstream backbones including Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Transformer. Experiments on the public Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration achieves near-theoretical-limit performance in discriminating among multiple target gases, with an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% at 5% false positive rate, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods with a 3.0% AUROC improvement and 91.0% standard deviation reduction compared to Class Anchor Clustering (CAC). The module maintains exceptional robustness across five sensor positions, with standard deviations below 0.0028. This work effectively addresses the critical challenge of simultaneously achieving high accuracy and high stability in open-set gas recognition, providing solid support for industrial E-nose deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Emotion-Coherent Reasoning for Multimodal LLMs via Emotional Rationale Verifier](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23506v4)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is transforming human-computer interaction (HCI) from surface-level exchanges into more nuanced and emotionally intelligent communication. To realize this shift, emotion understanding becomes essential allowing systems to capture subtle cues underlying user intent. Furthermore, providing faithful explanations for predicted emotions is crucial to ensure interpretability and build user trust. However, current MLLM-based methods often generate emotion explanations that diverge from the target labels and sometimes even contradict their own predicted emotions. This inconsistency poses a critical risk for misunderstanding and erodes reliability in interactive settings. To address this, we propose a novel approach: the Emotional Rationale Verifier (ERV) and an Explanation Reward. Our method guides the model to produce reasoning that is explicitly consistent with the target emotion during multimodal emotion recognition without modifying the model architecture or requiring additional paired video-description annotations. Our method significantly improves faithful explanation-prediction consistency and explanation emotion accuracy on the MAFW and DFEW datasets. Through extensive experiments and human evaluations, we show that our approach not only enhances alignment between explanation and prediction but also empowers MLLMs to deliver emotionally coherent, trustworthy interactions, marking a key step toward truly human-like HCI systems.</p></details> | 15 pages, 11 figures |
| **[SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation for Universal Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05221v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for medical image segmentation remains challenging due to its limited adaptability across diverse medical domains. Although fine-tuned variants, such as MedSAM, improve performance in scenarios similar to the training modalities or organs, they may lack generalizability to unseen data. To overcome this limitation, we propose SAM-aware Test-time Adaptation (SAM-TTA), a lightweight and flexible framework that preserves SAM's inherent generalization ability while enhancing segmentation accuracy for medical images. SAM-TTA tackles two major challenges: (1) input-level discrepancy caused by channel mismatches between natural and medical images, and (2) semantic-level discrepancy due to different object characteristics in natural versus medical images (e.g., with clear boundaries vs. ambiguous structures). To this end, we introduce two complementary components: a self-adaptive Bezier Curve-based Transformation (SBCT), which maps single-channel medical images into SAM-compatible three-channel images via a few learnable parameters to be optimized at test time; and IoU-guided Multi-scale Adaptation (IMA), which leverages SAM's intrinsic IoU scores to enforce high output confidence, dual-scale prediction consistency, and intermediate feature consistency, to improve semantic-level alignments. Extensive experiments on eight public medical image segmentation tasks, covering six grayscale and two color (endoscopic) tasks, demonstrate that SAM-TTA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods. Notably, on six grayscale datasets, SAM-TTA even surpasses fully fine-tuned models, achieving significant Dice improvements (i.e., average 4.8% and 7.4% gains over MedSAM and SAM-Med2D) and establishing a new paradigm for universal medical image segmentation. Code is available at https://github.com/JianghaoWu/SAM-TTA.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |

They convert high-level programs into executable hardware instructions - a crucial step in enabling reliable and scalable quantum computation. However, quantum compilation is still in its infancy, and many existing solutions are ad hoc, often developed independently and from scratch. The resulting lack of interoperability leads to significant missed potential, as quantum software tools remain isolated and cannot be seamlessly integrated into cohesive toolchains. The Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) has addressed analogous challenges in the classical domain. It was developed within the LLVM project, which has long powered robust software stacks and enabled compilation across diverse software and hardware components, with particular importance in high-performance computing environments. However, MLIR's steep learning curve poses a significant barrier to entry, particularly in quantum computing, where much of the software stack is still predominantly built by experimentalists out of necessity rather than by experienced software engineers. This paper provides a practical and hands-on guide for quantum software engineers to overcome this steep learning curve. Through a concrete case study linking Xanadu's PennyLane framework with the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), we outline actionable integration steps, highlight best practices, and share hard-earned insights from real-world development. This work aims to support quantum tool developers in navigating MLIR's complexities and to foster its adoption as a unifying bridge across a rapidly growing ecosystem of quantum software tools, ultimately guiding the development of more modular, interoperable, and integrated quantum software stacks.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

While they can be used for training data augmentation, synthesizing comprehensive target-domain variations remains slow, expensive, and incomplete. We propose an alternative: using diffusion models at test time to map target images back to the source distribution where the downstream model was trained. This approach requires only a source domain description, preserves the task model, and eliminates large-scale synthetic data generation. We demonstrate consistent improvements across segmentation, detection, and classification tasks under challenging environmental shifts in real-to-real domain generalization scenarios with unknown target distributions. Our analysis spans multiple generative and downstream models, including an ensemble variant for enhanced robustness. The method achieves substantial relative gains: 137% on BDD100K-Night, 68% on ImageNet-R, and 62% on DarkZurich.</p></details> | Preprint |

Yet, their adversarial robustness remains critically unexplored. This paper studies the phenomenon whereby specific short input phrases induce a partial amnesia effect in such models, by irreversibly overwriting information in their hidden states, referred to as a Hidden State Poisoning Attack (HiSPA). Our benchmark RoBench25 allows evaluating a model's information retrieval capabilities when subject to HiSPAs, and confirms the vulnerability of SSMs against such attacks. Even a recent 52B hybrid SSM-Transformer model from the Jamba family collapses on RoBench25 under optimized HiSPA triggers, whereas pure Transformers do not. We also observe that HiSPA triggers significantly weaken the Jamba model on the popular Open-Prompt-Injections benchmark, unlike pure Transformers. Finally, our interpretability study reveals patterns in Mamba's hidden layers during HiSPAs that could be used to build a HiSPA mitigation system.

We present Canonical Semantic Form (CSF), a language-agnostic semantic representation framework that enables direct translation from any source language to sign language without English mediation. CSF decomposes utterances into nine universal semantic slots: event, intent, time, condition, agent, object, location, purpose, and modifier. A key contribution is our comprehensive condition taxonomy comprising 35 condition types across eight semantic categories, enabling nuanced representation of conditional expressions common in everyday communication. We train a lightweight transformer-based extractor (0.74 MB) that achieves 99.03% average slot extraction accuracy across four typologically diverse languages: English, Vietnamese, Japanese, and French. The model demonstrates particularly strong performance on condition classification (99.4% accuracy) despite the 35-class complexity. With inference latency of 3.02ms on CPU, our approach enables real-time sign language generation in browser-based applications. We release our code, trained models, and multilingual dataset to support further research in accessible sign language technology.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 tables, code available at https://github.com/transybao1393/csf-sign-language</p></details> |

ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch, incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). It supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories, with particularly strong gains on question answering (+9.55 points), code retrieval (+2.41 points), and academic understanding (+0.66 points). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization.

While existing methods often rely on local heuristics, they frequently fail to address the strategic trade-offs between competing objectives in vast areas. To overcome this, we formulate the task as a multi-objective optimization problem (MOO) that balances frontier-based exploration with the exploitation of observed landmarks. Our prototype integrates three key pillars: (1) QOM [IROS05] for discriminative landmark encoding; (2) StructNav [RSS23] to enhance the navigation pipeline; and (3) a variable-horizon Set Orienteering Problem (SOP) formulation for globally coherent planning. To further support the framework's scalability, we provide a detailed theoretical foundation for the budget-constrained SOP formulation and the data-driven mode-switching strategy that enables long-horizon resource allocation. Additionally, we introduce a high-speed neural planner that distills the expert solver into a transformer-based model, reducing decision latency by a factor of nearly 10 while maintaining high planning quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, technical report</p></details> |

We reconstruct the irregular flow field point set into sequential format compatible with FNO input requirements, and then embed temporal bundling technique within a recurrent neural network (RNN) for multi-step prediction. We further employ a composite loss function to balance errors across different physical quantities. Experiments are conducted on three different types of irregular flow fields, including orthogonal and non-orthogonal grid configurations. Then we comprehensively analyze the physical component loss curves, flow field visualizations, and physical profiles. Results demonstrate that our approach significantly surpasses traditional numerical methods in computational efficiency while achieving high accuracy, with maximum relative $L_2$ errors of (0.78, 0.57, 0.35)% for ($p$, $T$, $\mathbf{u}$) respectively. This verifies that the method can efficiently and accurately simulate the temporal evolution of high-speed compressible flows in irregular domains.</p></details> | 18 pages, 15 figures |

Thus, developers can utilize TEEs to provide strong security guarantees for their programs, making sensitive operations like encrypted data storage, fingerprint verification, and remote attestation protected from malicious attacks. Despite the strong protections offered by TEEs, adapting existing programs to leverage such security guarantees is non-trivial, often requiring extensive domain knowledge and manual intervention, which makes TEEs less accessible to developers. This motivates us to design AutoTEE, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled approach that can automatically identify, partition, transform, and port sensitive functions into TEEs with minimal developer intervention. By manually reviewing 68 repositories, we constructed a benchmark dataset consisting of 385 sensitive functions eligible for transformation, on which AutoTEE achieves a high F1 score of 0.91. AutoTEE effectively transforms these sensitive functions into their TEE-compatible counterparts, achieving success rates of 90\% and 83\% for Java and Python, respectively. We further provide a mechanism to automatically port the transformed code to different TEE platforms, including Intel SGX and AMD SEV, demonstrating that the transformed programs run successfully and correctly on these platforms.</p></details> | 14 pages |

We present a deep learning framework for automated lung cancer screening from chest computed tomography (CT) images with integrated explainability. Using the IQ-OTH/NCCD dataset (1,197 scans across Normal, Benign, and Malignant classes), we evaluate a custom convolutional neural network (CNN) and three fine-tuned transfer learning backbones: DenseNet121, ResNet152, and VGG19. Models are trained with cost-sensitive learning to mitigate class imbalance and evaluated via accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. While ResNet152 achieved the highest accuracy (97.3%), DenseNet121 provided the best overall balance in precision, recall, and F1 (up to 92%, 90%, 91%, respectively). We further apply Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to visualize evidence contributing to predictions, improving clinical transparency. Results indicate that CNN-based approaches augmented with explainability can provide fast, accurate, and interpretable support for lung cancer screening, particularly in resource-limited settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables.

However, existing approaches often rely on synthetic reasoning annotations or external image retrieval, which can limit interpretability and generalizability. In this paper, we present Geo-R, a retrieval-free framework that uncovers structured reasoning paths from existing ground-truth coordinates and optimizes geolocation accuracy via reinforcement learning. We propose the Chain of Region, a rule-based hierarchical reasoning paradigm that generates precise, interpretable supervision by mapping GPS coordinates to geographic entities (e.g., country, province, city) without relying on model-generated or synthetic labels. Building on this, we introduce a lightweight reinforcement learning strategy with coordinate-aligned rewards based on Haversine distance, enabling the model to refine predictions through spatially meaningful feedback. Our approach bridges structured geographic reasoning with direct spatial supervision, yielding improved localization accuracy, stronger generalization, and more transparent inference. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of Geo-R, establishing a new retrieval-free paradigm for scalable and interpretable image geolocalization. To facilitate further research and ensure reproducibility, both the model and code will be made publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

The central thesis proposes that learning, across physical, biological, and computational systems, fundamentally constitutes the conversion of flux into structure through entropy export. Building on Prigogine's theory of dissipative structures, we establish a formal isomorphism between thermodynamic processes and Bayesian updating, demonstrating that sustainable learning systems must follow dissipative patterns where crystallized posteriors become priors for subsequent levels of emergence. We derive fundamental mathematical constants (e, π, φ) as fixed points of Bayesian inference under minimal axioms, suggesting these constants emerge necessarily from any system capable of representing and updating uncertainty. Furthermore, we propose a conjecture linking Gödel's incompleteness theorems to thermodynamic constraints, hypothesizing that pathologies of formal systems (incompleteness, undecidability) are structurally analogous to dissipation deficits in physical systems. As practical validation, we present a peer-to-peer network architecture implementing BEDS principles, achieving six orders of magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared to existing distributed consensus systems while enabling continuous learning. This work bridges fundamental physics, mathematical logic, and practical system design, offering both theoretical insights into the nature of learning and computation, and a concrete pathway toward sustainable artificial intelligence.</p></details> | 19 pages |

However, in case of flood mapping using Sen1Flood11 dataset as a downstream task, GFMs struggles to outperform the baseline U-Net, highlighting model's limitation in capturing critical local nuances. To address this, we present the Prithvi-Complementary Adaptive Fusion Encoder (CAFE), which integrate Prithvi GFM pretrained encoder with a parallel CNN residual branch enhanced by Convolutional Attention Modules (CAM). Prithvi-CAFE enables fast and efficient fine-tuning through adapters in Prithvi and performs multi-scale, multi-level fusion with CNN features, capturing critical local details while preserving long-range dependencies. We achieve state-of-the-art results on two comprehensive flood mapping datasets: Sen1Flood11 and FloodPlanet. On Sen1Flood11 test data, Prithvi-CAFE (IoU 83.41) outperforms the original Prithvi (IoU 82.50) and other major GFMs (TerraMind 82.90, DOFA 81.54, spectralGPT: 81.02). The improvement is even more pronounced on the hold-out test site, where Prithvi-CAFE achieves an IoU of 81.37 compared to the baseline U-Net (70.57) and original Prithvi (72.42).

We introduce POSEIDON (Physics-Optimized Seismic Energy Inference and Detection Operating Network), a physics-informed energy-based model for unified multi-task seismic event prediction, alongside the Poseidon dataset -- the largest open-source global earthquake catalog comprising 2.8 million events spanning 30 years. POSEIDON embeds fundamental seismological principles, including the Gutenberg-Richter magnitude-frequency relationship and Omori-Utsu aftershock decay law, as learnable constraints within an energy-based modeling framework. The architecture simultaneously addresses three interconnected prediction tasks: aftershock sequence identification, tsunami generation potential, and foreshock detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that POSEIDON achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks, outperforming gradient boosting, random forest, and CNN baselines with the highest average F1 score among all compared methods. Crucially, the learned physics parameters converge to scientifically interpretable values -- Gutenberg-Richter b-value of 0.752 and Omori-Utsu parameters p=0.835, c=0.1948 days -- falling within established seismological ranges while enhancing rather than compromising predictive accuracy. The Poseidon dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/BorisKriuk/Poseidon, providing pre-computed energy features, spatial grid indices, and standardized quality metrics to advance physics-informed seismic research.</p></details> | 8 pages, 14 figures |

The core idea is to liberate the latent vectors of abstract concepts from traditional static semantic representations, allowing them to be continuously updated through environmental interaction and reinforcement feedback. We construct a dual-loop architecture: the behavior loop adjusts action preferences based on environmental rewards, while the language loop updates the external latent vectors by reflecting on the semantic embeddings of generated text. Together, these mechanisms allow agents to develop stable and disentangled strategic styles over long-horizon multi-round interactions. Experiments show that agents' latent spaces exhibit clear convergence trajectories under reflection-driven updates, along with structured shifts at critical moments. Moreover, the system demonstrates an emergent ability to implicitly infer and continually adapt to emotional agents, even without shared rewards. These results indicate that, without modifying model parameters, an external latent space can provide language agents with a low-cost, scalable, and interpretable form of abstract strategic representation.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures.

Test-time guidance methods help mitigate this by offering controllable improvements in image fidelity through a trade-off with sample diversity. However, this benefit comes at a high computational cost, typically requiring dual forward passes during sampling. We propose the Domain-guided Fine-tuning (DogFit) method, an effective guidance mechanism for diffusion transfer learning that maintains controllability without incurring additional computational overhead. DogFit injects a domain-aware guidance offset into the training loss, effectively internalizing the guided behavior during the fine-tuning process. The domain-aware design is motivated by our observation that during fine-tuning, the unconditional source model offers a stronger marginal estimate than the target model. To support efficient controllable fidelity-diversity trade-offs at inference, we encode the guidance strength value as an additional model input through a lightweight conditioning mechanism. We further investigate the optimal placement and timing of the guidance offset during training and propose two simple scheduling strategies, i.e., late-start and cut-off, which improve generation quality and training stability. Experiments on DiT and SiT backbones across six diverse target domains show that DogFit can outperform prior guidance methods in transfer learning in terms of FID and FDDINOV2 while requiring up to 2x fewer sampling TFLOPS.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for poster presentation at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[CD4LM: Consistency Distillation and aDaptive Decoding for Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02236v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive large language models achieve strong results on many benchmarks, but decoding remains fundamentally latency-limited by sequential dependence on previously generated tokens. Diffusion language models (DLMs) promise parallel generation but suffer from a fundamental static-to-dynamic misalignment: Training optimizes local transitions under fixed schedules, whereas efficient inference requires adaptive "long-jump" refinements through unseen states. Our goal is to enable highly parallel decoding for DLMs with low number of function evaluations while preserving generation quality. To achieve this, we propose CD4LM, a framework that decouples training from inference via Discrete-Space Consistency Distillation (DSCD) and Confidence-Adaptive Decoding (CAD). Unlike standard objectives, DSCD trains a student to be trajectory-invariant, mapping diverse noisy states directly to the clean distribution. This intrinsic robustness enables CAD to dynamically allocate compute resources based on token confidence, aggressively skipping steps without the quality collapse typical of heuristic acceleration. On GSM8K, CD4LM matches the LLaDA baseline with a 5.18x wall-clock speedup; across code and math benchmarks, it strictly dominates the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier, achieving a 3.62x mean speedup while improving average accuracy.

| **[Unraveling MMDiT Blocks: Training-free Analysis and Enhancement of Text-conditioned Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02211v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent breakthroughs of transformer-based diffusion models, particularly with Multimodal Diffusion Transformers (MMDiT) driven models like FLUX and Qwen Image, have facilitated thrilling experiences in text-to-image generation and editing. To understand the internal mechanism of MMDiT-based models, existing methods tried to analyze the effect of specific components like positional encoding and attention layers. Yet, a comprehensive understanding of how different blocks and their interactions with textual conditions contribute to the synthesis process remains elusive. In this paper, we first develop a systematic pipeline to comprehensively investigate each block's functionality by removing, disabling and enhancing textual hidden-states at corresponding blocks. Our analysis reveals that 1) semantic information appears in earlier blocks and finer details are rendered in later blocks, 2) removing specific blocks is usually less disruptive than disabling text conditions, and 3) enhancing textual conditions in selective blocks improves semantic attributes. Building on these observations, we further propose novel training-free strategies for improved text alignment, precise editing, and acceleration. Extensive experiments demonstrated that our method outperforms various baselines and remains flexible across text-to-image generation, image editing, and inference acceleration. Our method improves T2I-Combench++ from 56.92% to 63.00% and GenEval from 66.42% to 71.63% on SD3.5, without sacrificing synthesis quality. These results advance understanding of MMDiT models and provide valuable insights to unlock new possibilities for further improvements.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, mainstream training paradigms face key challenges: Behavior Cloning is simple and effective through imitation but suffers from low behavioral diversity, while Reinforcement Learning is capable of discovering novel strategies through exploration but heavily relies on manually designed reward functions. To address the conflict between these two methods, we present CORE, a Code-based Inverse Self-Training Framework with Graph Expansion that bridges imitation and exploration, offering a novel training framework that promotes behavioral diversity while eliminating the reliance on manually reward design. Specifically, we introduce Semantic Code Abstraction to automatically infers reward functions from expert demonstrations without manual design. The inferred reward function, referred to as the Label Function, is executable code that verifies one key step within a task. Building on this, we propose Strategy Graph Expansion to enhance in-domain behavioral diversity, which constructs a multi-path graph called Strategy Graph that captures diverse valid solutions beyond expert demonstrations. Furthermore, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Extrapolation, which enriches out-of-domain behavioral diversity by utilizing both successful and failed trajectories to expand the task space. Experiments on Web and Android platforms demonstrate that CORE significantly improves both overall performance and generalization, highlighting its potential as a robust and generalizable training paradigm for building powerful virtual agents.</p></details> | 19 pages, 12 figures |

Meeting these obligations in the alert-to-takeover gap calls for a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver. Classical maritime autonomy stacks struggle when the correct action depends on meaning (e.g., diver-down flag means people in the water, fire close by means hazard). We argue (i) that vision-language models (VLMs) provide semantic awareness for such out-of-distribution situations, and (ii) that a fast-slow anomaly pipeline with a short-horizon, human-overridable fallback maneuver makes this practical in the handover window. We introduce Semantic Lookout, a camera-only, candidate-constrained VLM fallback maneuver selector that selects one cautious action (or station-keeping) from water-valid, world-anchored trajectories under continuous human authority. On 40 harbor scenes we measure per-call scene understanding and latency, alignment with human consensus (model majority-of-three voting), short-horizon risk-relief on fire hazard scenes, and an on-water alert->fallback maneuver->operator handover. Sub-10 s models retain most of the awareness of slower state-of-the-art models. The fallback maneuver selector outperforms geometry-only baselines and increases standoff distance on fire scenes. A field run verifies end-to-end operation. These results support VLMs as semantic fallback maneuver selectors compatible with the draft IMO MASS Code, within practical latency budgets, and motivate future work on domain-adapted, hybrid autonomy that pairs foundation-model semantics with multi-sensor bird's-eye-view perception and short-horizon replanning.

While statistically optimal estimators exist for general heavy-tailed distributions, they often rely on computationally expensive techniques like semidefinite programming or iterative M-estimation ($O(d^3)$). In this work, we target the specific regime of \textbf{Sub-Weibull distributions} (characterized by stretched exponential tails $\exp(-t^α)$). We investigate a computationally efficient alternative: the \textbf{Cross-Fitted Norm-Truncated Estimator}. Unlike element-wise truncation, our approach preserves the spectral geometry while requiring $O(Nd^2)$ operations, which represents the theoretical lower bound for constructing a full covariance matrix. Although spherical truncation is geometrically suboptimal for anisotropic data, we prove that within the Sub-Weibull class, the exponential tail decay compensates for this mismatch. Leveraging weighted Hanson-Wright inequalities, we derive non-asymptotic error bounds showing that our estimator recovers the optimal sub-Gaussian rate $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r(Σ)/N})$ with high probability. This provides a scalable solution for high-dimensional data that exhibits tails heavier than Gaussian but lighter than polynomial decay.</p></details> | <details><summary>Trunc...</summary><p>Truncating the data without standardizing it first is meaningless</p></details> |

Even when memory capacity exceeds the theoretical requirement, conventional scheduling algorithms fail because they do not account for this dynamic memory growth -- a system that should be stable can become unstable under poor scheduling. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to establish a tractable benchmark and derive the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm. WAIT uses threshold-based batching to prevent eviction by keeping the system near load balance, achieving near-optimal throughput when output lengths are known. For practical settings where output lengths are unknown at arrival, we introduce Nested WAIT. Rather than predicting output lengths, Nested WAIT classifies prompts on-the-fly: short prompts complete early and exit, while longer prompts naturally advance to later segments. A safety buffer provides high-probability protection against memory overflow with only logarithmic overhead. Theoretical analysis establishes near-optimal performance in the asymptotic regime. Experiments on Llama-7B with an A100 GPU demonstrate that our approach achieves superior throughput and reduced latency compared to vLLM and Sarathi. This work applies operations research principles to establish a theoretical framework for LLM deployment under memory constraints.</p></details> | 49 pages, 18 figures |
| **[Car Drag Coefficient Prediction from 3D Point Clouds Using a Slice-Based Surrogate Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02112v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automotive industry's pursuit of enhanced fuel economy and performance necessitates efficient aerodynamic design. However, traditional evaluation methods such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and wind tunnel testing are resource intensive, hindering rapid iteration in the early design stages. Machine learning-based surrogate models offer a promising alternative, yet many existing approaches suffer from high computational complexity, limited interpretability, or insufficient accuracy for detailed geometric inputs. This paper introduces a novel lightweight surrogate model for the prediction of the aerodynamic drag coefficient (Cd) based on a sequential slice-wise processing of the geometry of the 3D vehicle. Inspired by medical imaging, 3D point clouds of vehicles are decomposed into an ordered sequence of 2D cross-sectional slices along the stream-wise axis. Each slice is encoded by a lightweight PointNet2D module, and the sequence of slice embeddings is processed by a bidirectional LSTM to capture longitudinal geometric evolution. The model, trained and evaluated on the DrivAerNet++ dataset, achieves a high coefficient of determination (R^2 > 0.9528) and a low mean absolute error (MAE approx 6.046 x 10^{-3}) in Cd prediction. With an inference time of approximately 0.025 seconds per sample on a consumer-grade GPU, our approach provides fast, accurate, and interpretable aerodynamic feedback, facilitating more agile and informed automotive design exploration.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures.

In this regard, we discuss multiple candidate estimators and study their theoretical properties, sharp large sample optimality, and numerical qualities under a high-dimensional proportional asymptotic framework.</p></details> | Fixed citations |

We introduce van der Put Neural Networks (v-PuNNs), the first architecture whose neurons are characteristic functions of p-adic balls in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Under our Transparent Ultrametric Representation Learning (TURL) principle every weight is itself a p-adic number, giving exact subtree semantics. A new Finite Hierarchical Approximation Theorem shows that a depth-K v-PuNN with $\sum_{j=0}^{K-1}p^{\,j}$ neurons universally represents any K-level tree. Because gradients vanish in this discrete space, we propose Valuation-Adaptive Perturbation Optimization (VAPO), with a fast deterministic variant (HiPaN-DS) and a moment-based one (HiPaN / Adam-VAPO). On three canonical benchmarks our CPU-only implementation sets new state-of-the-art: WordNet nouns (52,427 leaves) 99.96% leaf accuracy in 16 min; GO molecular-function 96.9% leaf / 100% root in 50 s; NCBI Mammalia Spearman $ρ= -0.96$ with true taxonomic distance. The learned metric is perfectly ultrametric (zero triangle violations), and its fractal and information-theoretic properties are analyzed. Beyond classification we derive structural invariants for quantum systems (HiPaQ) and controllable generative codes for tabular data (Tab-HiPaN). v-PuNNs therefore bridge number theory and deep learning, offering exact, interpretable, and efficient models for hierarchical data.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: C...</summary><p>v2: Corrected mathematical statements in Section 3.1.3 and Appendix A regarding the van der Put basis properties.

Current mainstream approaches primarily rely on the "LLM-as-a-judge" paradigm, where an LLM is prompted to serve as an evaluator to assess dialogue quality. However, such methods often suffer from various biases, which undermine the reliability and consistency of the evaluation results. To mitigate these biases, recent methods employ multiple LLMs as judges and aggregate their judgments to select the optimal assessment. Although effective, this multi-judge approach incurs significant computational overhead during inference. In this paper, we propose an efficient dialogue evaluator that captures the collective wisdom of multiple LLM judges by aggregating their preference knowledge into a single model. Our approach preserves the advantages of diverse multi-judge feedback while drastically reducing the evaluation cost, enabling fast, flexible, and fine-grained dialogue quality assessment. Extensive experiments on seven single rating and pairwise comparison dialogue evaluation benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines across diverse scenarios, showcasing its efficiency and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 pages, under review</p></details> |

Yet it remains unclear how reliably they extract and infer information at scale. Performance varies with context length and strongly interacts with how information is distributed in real-world corpora. Motivated by these observations, we study how fact placement, corpus-level fact distributions, and Don't Make It Up prompts influence model behavior. We introduce an extended needle-in-a-haystack benchmark across four production-scale models: Gemini-2.5-flash, ChatGPT-5-mini, Claude-4.5-haiku, and Deepseek-v3.2-chat. Unlike prior work, we separately evaluate literal extraction, logical inference, and hallucination risk. Our study considers both positional effects and realistic distributions of evidence across long contexts, as well as prompts that explicitly discourage fabrication. We find that longer contexts alone do not guarantee better performance and can be detrimental when relevant evidence is diluted or widely dispersed. Performance varies substantially across models: some show severe degradation under realistic conditions, while others remain more robust at longer context lengths. Anti-hallucination (AH) instructions can make some models overly conservative, sharply reducing accuracy in literal extraction and logical inference. While we do not directly compare retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and cache-augmented generation (CAG), our results suggest many failures stem from ineffective context utilization. Models often struggle to identify and prioritize relevant information even when it is present. These findings have direct practical implications, as enterprise workflows increasingly involve pasting large volumes of unfiltered documents into LLM prompts. Effective context length and model-specific robustness to long contexts are therefore critical for reliable LLM deployment in research and business.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 8 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

We introduce a general, model-agnostic methodology for injecting privileged information-such as bounding box masks, saliency maps, and depth cues-into deep learning-based object detectors through a teacher-student architecture. Experiments are conducted across five state-of-the-art object detection models and multiple public benchmarks, including UAV-based litter detection datasets and Pascal VOC 2012, to assess the impact on accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Our results demonstrate that LUPI-trained students consistently outperform their baseline counterparts, achieving significant boosts in detection accuracy with no increase in inference complexity or model size. Performance improvements are especially marked for medium and large objects, while ablation studies reveal that intermediate weighting of teacher guidance optimally balances learning from privileged and standard inputs. The findings affirm that the LUPI framework provides an effective and practical strategy for advancing object detection systems in both resource-constrained and real-world settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available on GitHub: https://github.com/mbar0075/lupi-for-object-detection</p></details> |

However, they still struggle to generate images that accurately reflect the number of objects specified in the input prompt. Several approaches have been proposed that rely on either external counting modules for iterative refinement or quantity representations derived from learned tokens or latent features. However, they still have limitations in accurately reflecting the specified number of objects and overlook an important structural characteristic--The number of object instances in the generated image is largely determined in the early timesteps of the denoising process. To correctly reflect the object quantity for image generation, the highly activated regions in the object cross-attention map at the early timesteps should match the input object quantity, while each region should be clearly separated. To address this issue, we propose \textit{CountCluster}, a method that guides the object cross-attention map to be clustered according to the specified object count in the input, without relying on any external tools or additional training. The proposed method partitions the object cross-attention map into $k$ clusters at inference time based on attention scores, defines an ideal distribution in which each cluster is spatially well-separated, and optimizes the latent to align with this target distribution. Our method achieves an average improvement of 18.5\%p in object count accuracy compared to existing methods, and demonstrates superior quantity control performance across a variety of prompts.

In this article, we present MindChat, a privacy-preserving LLM for mental health support, together with MindCorpus, a synthetic multi-turn counseling dataset constructed via a multi-agent role-playing framework. To synthesize high-quality counseling data, the developed dialogue-construction framework employs a dual closed-loop feedback design to integrate psychological expertise and counseling techniques through role-playing: (i) turn-level critique-and-revision to improve coherence and counseling appropriateness within a session, and (ii) session-level strategy refinement to progressively enrich counselor behaviors across sessions. To mitigate privacy risks under decentralized data ownership, we fine-tune the base model using federated learning with parameter-efficient LoRA adapters and incorporate differentially private optimization to reduce membership and memorization risks. Experiments on synthetic-data quality assessment and counseling capability evaluation show that MindCorpus improves training effectiveness and that MindChat is competitive with existing general and counseling-oriented LLM baselines under both automatic LLM-judge and human evaluation protocols, while exhibiting reduced privacy leakage under membership inference attacks.</p></details> | 33 pages, 16 figures |

We train a lightweight transformer-based extractor (0.74 MB) that achieves 99.03% average slot extraction accuracy across four typologically diverse languages: English, Vietnamese, Japanese, and French. The model demonstrates particularly strong performance on condition classification (99.4% accuracy) despite the 35-class complexity.

ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch, incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). It supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories, with particularly strong gains on question answering (+9.55 points), code retrieval (+2.41 points), and academic understanding (+0.66 points). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization.

During iterative design, adjustments to the geometric shape inevitably require synchronized edits to the underlying parametric sequence, called geometry-driven parametric CAD editing. The task calls for 1) preserving the original sequence's structure, 2) ensuring each edit's semantic validity, and 3) maintaining high shape fidelity to the target shape, all under scarce editing data triplets. We present CADMorph, an iterative plan-generate-verify framework that orchestrates pretrained domain-specific foundation models during inference: a parameter-to-shape (P2S) latent diffusion model and a masked-parameter-prediction (MPP) model. In the planning stage, cross-attention maps from the P2S model pinpoint the segments that need modification and offer editing masks. The MPP model then infills these masks with semantically valid edits in the generation stage. During verification, the P2S model embeds each candidate sequence in shape-latent space, measures its distance to the target shape, and selects the closest one. The three stages leverage the inherent geometric consciousness and design knowledge in pretrained priors, and thus tackle structure preservation, semantic validity, and shape fidelity respectively. Besides, both P2S and MPP models are trained without triplet data, bypassing the data-scarcity bottleneck. CADMorph surpasses GPT-4o and specialized CAD baselines, and supports downstream applications such as iterative editing and reverse-engineering enhancement.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

From this we derive an EKG discovery algorithm based on statistical inference rather than an ad hoc or heuristic-based strategy, or relying on manual analysis from domain experts. This approach comes at the computational cost of exploring a large, non-convex hypothesis space. In particular, solving the maximum likelihood term in our objective function involves counting the number of linear extensions of posets, which in general is #P-complete. Fortunately, bound estimates suffice for model comparison, and admit incorporation into a bespoke branch-and-bound algorithm. We establish an upper bound on our objective function which we show to be antitonic w.r.t. search depth for branching rules that are monotonic w.r.t. model inclusion. This allows pruning of large portions of the search space, which we show experimentally leads to rapid convergence toward optimal solutions that are consistent with manually built EKGs.</p></details> | 2-column IEEE format |
| **[Multi-Robot Data-Free Continual Communicative Learning (CCL) from Black-Box Visual Place Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02256v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In emerging multi-robot societies, heterogeneous agents must continually extract and integrate local knowledge from one another through communication, even when their internal models are completely opaque. Existing approaches to continual or collaborative learning for visual place recognition (VPR) largely assume white-box access to model parameters or shared training datasets, which is unrealistic when robots encounter unknown peers in the wild. This paper introduces \emph{Continual Communicative Learning (CCL)}, a data-free multi-robot framework in which a traveler robot (student) continually improves its VPR capability by communicating with black-box teacher models via a constrained query--response channel. We repurpose Membership Inference Attacks (MIA), originally developed as privacy attacks on machine learning models, as a constructive communication primitive to reconstruct pseudo-training sets from black-box VPR teachers without accessing their parameters or raw data. To overcome the intrinsic communication bottleneck caused by the low sampling efficiency of black-box MIA, we propose a prior-based query strategy that leverages the student's own VPR prior to focus queries on informative regions of the embedding space, thereby reducing the knowledge transfer (KT) cost. Experimental results on a standard multi-session VPR benchmark demonstrate that the proposed CCL framework yields substantial performance gains for low-performing robots under modest communication budgets, highlighting CCL as a promising building block for scalable and fault-tolerant multi-robot systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, technical report</p></details> |

It is useful for various real-world applications, such as abstractive snippet generation or more recent retrieval augmented generation (RAG). A prototypical QFS pipeline consists of a retriever (sparse or dense retrieval) and a generator (usually a large language model). However, applying large language models (LLM) potentially leads to hallucinations, especially when the evidence contradicts the prior belief of LLMs. There has been growing interest in developing new decoding methods to improve generation quality and reduce hallucination. In this work, we conduct a large-scale reproducibility study on one recently proposed decoding method\, -- \,Context-aware Decoding (CAD). In addition to replicating CAD's experiments on news summarization datasets, we include experiments on QFS datasets, and conduct more rigorous analysis on computational complexity and hyperparameter sensitivity. Experiments with eight different language models show that performance-wise, CAD improves QFS quality by (1) reducing factuality errors/hallucinations while (2) mostly retaining the match of lexical patterns, measured by ROUGE scores, while also at a cost of increased inference-time FLOPs and reduced decoding speed. The \href{https://github.com/zhichaoxu-shufe/context-aware-decoding-qfs}{code implementation} based on Huggingface Library is made available</p></details> | technical report |
| **[Sharp Structure-Agnostic Lower Bounds for General Linear Functional Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17341v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish a general statistical optimality theory for estimation problems where the target parameter is a linear functional of an unknown nuisance component that must be estimated from data. This formulation covers many causal and predictive parameters and has applications to numerous disciplines. We adopt the structure-agnostic framework introduced by \citet{balakrishnan2023fundamental}, which poses no structural properties on the nuisance functions other than access to black-box estimators that achieve some statistical estimation rate. This framework is particularly appealing when one is only willing to consider estimation strategies that use non-parametric regression and classification oracles as black-box sub-processes. Within this framework, we first prove the statistical optimality of the celebrated and widely used doubly robust estimators for the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), the most central parameter in causal inference. We then characterize the minimax optimal rate under the general formulation. Notably, we differentiate between two regimes in which double robustness can and cannot be achieved and in which first-order debiasing yields different error rates. Our result implies that first-order debiasing is simultaneously optimal in both regimes. We instantiate our theory by deriving optimal error rates that recover existing results and extend to various settings of interest, including the case when the nuisance is defined by generalized regressions and when covariate shift exists for training and test distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>117 p...</summary><p>117 pages; generalizes and subsumes arXiv:2402.14264 by the same authors</p></details> |
| **[SJTU:Spatial judgments in multimodal models towards unified segmentation through coordinate detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02565v3)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advances in vision-language understanding, implementing image segmentation within multimodal architectures remains a fundamental challenge in modern artificial intelligence systems. Existing vision-language models, which primarily rely on backbone architectures or CLIP-based embedding learning, demonstrate inherent limitations in fine-grained spatial localization and operational capabilities. This paper introduces SJTU: Spatial Judgments in Multimodal Models - Towards Unified Segmentation through Coordinate Detection, a framework that leverages spatial coordinate understanding to bridge vision-language interaction and precise segmentation, enabling accurate target identification through natural language instructions. The framework presents an approach for integrating segmentation techniques with vision-language models through spatial inference in multimodal space. By utilizing normalized coordinate detection for bounding boxes and transforming them into actionable segmentation outputs, we establish a connection between spatial and language representations in multimodal architectures. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance across benchmark datasets, achieving IoU scores of 0.5958 on COCO 2017 and 0.6758 on Pascal VOC. Testing on a single NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU with 512x512 resolution images yields an average inference time of 7 seconds per image, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in both accuracy and practical deployability.

| **[Causal inference for censored data with continuous marks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01854v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a framework for causal inference in the presence of censored data, where the failure time is marked by a continuous variable known as a mark. The mark can be viewed as an extension of the failure cause in the classical competing risks model where the cause of failure is replaced by a continuous mark only observed at uncensored failure times. Due to the continuous nature of the marks, observations at each specific mark are sparse, making the identification and estimation of causality a challenging task. To address this issue, we define a new mark-specific treatment effect within the potential outcomes framework and characterize its identifying conditions. We then propose a local smoothing causal estimand and establish its asymptotic properties. We evaluate our method using simulation studies as well as a real dataset from the Antibody Mediated Prevention trials.</p></details> | 22 |
| **[MORE: Multi-Objective Adversarial Attacks on Speech Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01852v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large-scale automatic speech recognition (ASR) models such as Whisper has greatly expanded their adoption across diverse real-world applications. Ensuring robustness against even minor input perturbations is therefore critical for maintaining reliable performance in real-time environments. While prior work has mainly examined accuracy degradation under adversarial attacks, robustness with respect to efficiency remains largely unexplored. This narrow focus provides only a partial understanding of ASR model vulnerabilities. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive study of ASR robustness under multiple attack scenarios. We introduce MORE, a multi-objective repetitive doubling encouragement attack, which jointly degrades recognition accuracy and inference efficiency through a hierarchical staged repulsion-anchoring mechanism. Specifically, we reformulate multi-objective adversarial optimization into a hierarchical framework that sequentially achieves the dual objectives. To further amplify effectiveness, we propose a novel repetitive encouragement doubling objective (REDO) that induces duplicative text generation by maintaining accuracy degradation and periodically doubling the predicted sequence length. Overall, MORE compels ASR models to produce incorrect transcriptions at a substantially higher computational cost, triggered by a single adversarial input. Experiments show that MORE consistently yields significantly longer transcriptions while maintaining high word error rates compared to existing baselines, underscoring its effectiveness in multi-objective adversarial attack.</p></details> | 19 pages |
