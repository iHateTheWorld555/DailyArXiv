| **[MedMO: Grounding and Understanding Multimodal Large Language Model for Medical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06965v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have rapidly advanced, yet their adoption in medicine remains limited by gaps in domain coverage, modality alignment, and grounded reasoning. In this work, we introduce MedMO, a medical foundation model built upon a generalized MLLM architecture and trained exclusively on large-scale, domain-specific data. MedMO follows a multi-stage training recipe: (i) cross-modal pretraining to align heterogeneous visual encoders with a medical language backbone; (ii) instruction tuning on multi-task supervision that spans captioning, VQA, report generation, retrieval, and grounded disease localization with bounding boxes; and (iii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards that combine factuality checks with a box-level GIoU reward to strengthen spatial grounding and step-by-step reasoning in complex clinical scenarios. MedMO consistently outperforms strong open-source medical MLLMs across multiple modalities and tasks. On VQA benchmarks, MedMO achieves an average accuracy improvement of +13.7% over the baseline and performs within 1.9% of the SOTA Fleming-VL. For text-based QA, it attains +6.9% over the baseline and +14.5% over Fleming-VL. In medical report generation, MedMO delivers significant gains in both semantic and clinical accuracy. Moreover, it exhibits strong grounding capability, achieving an IoU improvement of +40.4 over the baseline and +37.0% over Fleming-VL, underscoring its robust spatial reasoning and localization performance. Evaluations across radiology, ophthalmology, and pathology-microscopy confirm MedMO's broad cross-modality generalization. We release two versions of MedMO: 4B and 8B.

| **[InftyThink+: Effective and Efficient Infinite-Horizon Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06960v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large reasoning models achieve strong performance by scaling inference-time chain-of-thought, but this paradigm suffers from quadratic cost, context length limits, and degraded reasoning due to lost-in-the-middle effects. Iterative reasoning mitigates these issues by periodically summarizing intermediate thoughts, yet existing methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and fail to optimize when to summarize, what to preserve, and how to resume reasoning. We propose InftyThink+, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the entire iterative reasoning trajectory, building on model-controlled iteration boundaries and explicit summarization. InftyThink+ adopts a two-stage training scheme with supervised cold-start followed by trajectory-level reinforcement learning, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by a clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/InftyThink-Plus Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/InftyThink-Plus</p></details> |
| **[CineScene: Implicit 3D as Effective Scene Representation for Cinematic Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06959v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cinematic video production requires control over scene-subject composition and camera movement, but live-action shooting remains costly due to the need for constructing physical sets. To address this, we introduce the task of cinematic video generation with decoupled scene context: given multiple images of a static environment, the goal is to synthesize high-quality videos featuring dynamic subject while preserving the underlying scene consistency and following a user-specified camera trajectory. We present CineScene, a framework that leverages implicit 3D-aware scene representation for cinematic video generation. Our key innovation is a novel context conditioning mechanism that injects 3D-aware features in an implicit way: By encoding scene images into visual representations through VGGT, CineScene injects spatial priors into a pretrained text-to-video generation model by additional context concatenation, enabling camera-controlled video synthesis with consistent scenes and dynamic subjects. To further enhance the model's robustness, we introduce a simple yet effective random-shuffling strategy for the input scene images during training. To address the lack of training data, we construct a scene-decoupled dataset with Unreal Engine 5, containing paired videos of scenes with and without dynamic subjects, panoramic images representing the underlying static scene, along with their camera trajectories. Experiments show that CineScene achieves state-of-the-art performance in scene-consistent cinematic video generation, handling large camera movements and demonstrating generalization across diverse environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: https://karine-huang.github.io/CineScene/</p></details> |
| **[Improving Credit Card Fraud Detection with an Optimized Explainable Boosting Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06955v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Addressing class imbalance is a central challenge in credit card fraud detection, as it directly impacts predictive reliability in real-world financial systems. To overcome this, the study proposes an enhanced workflow based on the Explainable Boosting Machine (EBM)-a transparent, state-of-the-art implementation of the GA2M algorithm-optimized through systematic hyperparameter tuning, feature selection, and preprocessing refinement. Rather than relying on conventional sampling techniques that may introduce bias or cause information loss, the optimized EBM achieves an effective balance between accuracy and interpretability, enabling precise detection of fraudulent transactions while providing actionable insights into feature importance and interaction effects. Furthermore, the Taguchi method is employed to optimize both the sequence of data scalers and model hyperparameters, ensuring robust, reproducible, and systematically validated performance improvements. Experimental evaluation on benchmark credit card data yields an ROC-AUC of 0.983, surpassing prior EBM baselines (0.975) and outperforming Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Decision Tree models. These results highlight the potential of interpretable machine learning and data-driven optimization for advancing trustworthy fraud analytics in financial systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[DreamDojo: A Generalist Robot World Model from Large-Scale Human Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06949v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Being able to simulate the outcomes of actions in varied environments will revolutionize the development of generalist agents at scale. However, modeling these world dynamics, especially for dexterous robotics tasks, poses significant challenges due to limited data coverage and scarce action labels. As an endeavor towards this end, we introduce DreamDojo, a foundation world model that learns diverse interactions and dexterous controls from 44k hours of egocentric human videos. Our data mixture represents the largest video dataset to date for world model pretraining, spanning a wide range of daily scenarios with diverse objects and skills. To address the scarcity of action labels, we introduce continuous latent actions as unified proxy actions, enhancing interaction knowledge transfer from unlabeled videos. After post-training on small-scale target robot data, DreamDojo demonstrates a strong understanding of physics and precise action controllability. We also devise a distillation pipeline that accelerates DreamDojo to a real-time speed of 10.81 FPS and further improves context consistency. Our work enables several important applications based on generative world models, including live teleoperation, policy evaluation, and model-based planning. Systematic evaluation on multiple challenging out-of-distribution (OOD) benchmarks verifies the significance of our method for simulating open-world, contact-rich tasks, paving the way for general-purpose robot world models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://dreamdojo-world.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Optimal Derivative Feedback Control for an Active Magnetic Levitation System: An Experimental Study on Data-Driven Approaches](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06944v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the design and implementation of data-driven optimal derivative feedback controllers for an active magnetic levitation system. A direct, model-free control design method based on the reinforcement learning framework is compared with an indirect optimal control design derived from a numerically identified mathematical model of the system. For the direct model-free approach, a policy iteration procedure is proposed, which adds an iteration layer called the epoch loop to gather multiple sets of process data, providing a more diverse dataset and helping reduce learning biases. This direct control design method is evaluated against a comparable optimal control solution designed from a plant model obtained through the combined Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control (DMDc) and Prediction Error Minimization (PEM) system identification. Results show that while both controllers can stabilize and improve the performance of the magnetic levitation system when compared to controllers designed from a nominal model, the direct model-free approach consistently outperforms the indirect solution when multiple epochs are allowed. The iterative refinement of the optimal control law over the epoch loop provides the direct approach a clear advantage over the indirect method, which relies on a single set of system data to determine the identified model and control.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Optimal Turkish Subword Strategies at Scale: Systematic Evaluation of Data, Vocabulary, Morphology Interplay](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06942v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tokenization is a pivotal design choice for neural language modeling in morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Turkish, where productive agglutination challenges both vocabulary efficiency and morphological fidelity. Prior studies have explored tokenizer families and vocabulary sizes but typically (i) vary vocabulary without systematically controlling the tokenizer's training corpus, (ii) provide limited intrinsic diagnostics, and (iii) evaluate a narrow slice of downstream tasks. We present the first comprehensive, principled study of Turkish subword tokenization; a "subwords manifest", that jointly varies vocabulary size and tokenizer training corpus size (data and vocabulary coupling), compares multiple tokenizer families under matched parameter budgets (WordPiece, morphology level, and character baselines), and evaluates across semantic (NLI, STS, sentiment analysis, NER), syntactic (POS, dependency parsing), and morphology-sensitive probes. To explain why tokenizers succeed or fail, we introduce a morphology-aware diagnostic toolkit that goes beyond coarse aggregates to boundary-level micro/macro F1, decoupled lemma atomicity vs. surface boundary hits, over/under-segmentation indices, character/word edit distances (CER/WER), continuation rates, and affix-type coverage and token-level atomicity. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a systematic investigation of the vocabulary-corpus-success triad; (ii) a unified, morphology-aware evaluation framework linking intrinsic diagnostics to extrinsic outcomes; (iii) controlled comparisons identifying when character-level and morphology-level tokenization pay off; and (iv) an open-source release of evaluation code, tokenizer pipelines, and models. As the first work of its kind, this "subwords manifest" delivers actionable guidance for building effective tokenizers in MRLs and establishes a reproducible foundation for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Cambridge NLP journal, all rights belong to them</p></details> |
| **[code_transformed: The Influence of Large Language Models on Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12014v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 20,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake_case function names in Python code increased from 40.7% in Q1 2023 to 49.8% in Q3 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Our experimental results may provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.

| **[Teaching Models to Teach Themselves: Reasoning at the Edge of Learnability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18778v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Can a model learn to escape its own learning plateau? Reinforcement learning methods for finetuning large reasoning models stall on datasets with low initial success rates, and thus little training signal. We investigate a fundamental question: Can a pretrained LLM leverage latent knowledge to generate an automated curriculum for problems it cannot solve? To explore this, we design SOAR: A self-improvement framework designed to surface these pedagogical signals through meta-RL. A teacher copy of the model proposes synthetic problems for a student copy, and is rewarded with its improvement on a small subset of hard problems. Critically, SOAR grounds the curriculum in measured student progress rather than intrinsic proxy rewards. Our study on the hardest subsets of mathematical benchmarks (0/128 success) reveals three core findings. First, we show that it is possible to realize bi-level meta-RL that unlocks learning under sparse, binary rewards by sharpening a latent capacity of pretrained models to generate useful stepping stones. Second, grounded rewards outperform intrinsic reward schemes used in prior LLM self-play, reliably avoiding the instability and diversity collapse modes they typically exhibit. Third, analyzing the generated questions reveals that structural quality and well-posedness are more critical for learning progress than solution correctness. Our results suggest that the ability to generate useful stepping stones does not require the preexisting ability to actually solve the hard problems, paving a principled path to escape reasoning plateaus without additional curated data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Blog ...</summary><p>Blog post: https://ssundaram21.github.io/soar/</p></details> |
| **[Dataset Distillation as Pushforward Optimal Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07681v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation aims to find a synthetic training set such that training on the synthetic data achieves similar performance to training on real data, with orders of magnitude less computational requirements. Existing methods can be broadly categorized as either bi-level optimization problems that have neural network training heuristics as the lower level problem, or disentangled methods that bypass the bi-level optimization by matching distributions of data. The latter method has the major advantages of speed and scalability in terms of size of both training and distilled datasets. We demonstrate that when equipped with an encoder-decoder structure, the empirically successful disentangled methods can be reformulated as an optimal quantization problem, where a finite set of points is found to approximate the underlying probability measure by minimizing the expected projection distance. In particular, we link existing disentangled dataset distillation methods to the classical optimal quantization and Wasserstein barycenter problems, demonstrating consistency of distilled datasets for diffusion-based generative priors. We propose Dataset Distillation by Optimal Quantization, based on clustering in a latent space. Compared to the previous SOTA method D\textsuperscript{4}M, we achieve better performance and inter-model generalization on the ImageNet-1K dataset with trivial additional computation, and SOTA performance in higher image-per-class settings. Using the distilled noise initializations in a stronger diffusion transformer model, we obtain SOTA distillation performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets, outperforming diffusion guidance methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, https://openreview.net/forum?id=FMSp8AUF3m</p></details> |
| **[Reciprocal Latent Fields for Precomputed Sound Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06937v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic sound propagation is essential for immersion in a virtual scene, yet physically accurate wave-based simulations remain computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Wave coding methods address this limitation by precomputing and compressing impulse responses of a given scene into a set of scalar acoustic parameters, which can reach unmanageable sizes in large environments with many source-receiver pairs. We introduce Reciprocal Latent Fields (RLF), a memory-efficient framework for encoding and predicting these acoustic parameters. The RLF framework employs a volumetric grid of trainable latent embeddings decoded with a symmetric function, ensuring acoustic reciprocity. We study a variety of decoders and show that leveraging Riemannian metric learning leads to a better reproduction of acoustic phenomena in complex scenes. Experimental validation demonstrates that RLF maintains replication quality while reducing the memory footprint by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a MUSHRA-like subjective listening test indicates that sound rendered via RLF is perceptually indistinguishable from ground-truth simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tempo...</summary><p>Temporary pre-print, will be updated.

| **[On micromodes in Bayesian posterior distributions and their implications for MCMC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06931v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the existence and severity of local modes in posterior distributions from Bayesian analyses. These are known to occur in posterior tails resulting from heavy-tailed error models such as those used in robust regression. To understand this phenomenon clearly, we consider in detail location models with Student-$t$ errors in dimension $d$ with sample size $n$. For sufficiently heavy-tailed data-generating distributions, extreme observations become increasingly isolated as $n \to \infty$. We show that each such observation induces a unique local posterior mode with probability tending to $1$. We refer to such a local mode as a micromode. These micromodes are typically small in height but their domains of attraction are large and grow polynomially with $n$. We then connect this posterior geometry to computation. We establish an Arrhenius law for the time taken by one-dimensional piecewise deterministic Monte Carlo algorithms to exit these micromodes. Our analysis identifies a phase transition where a misspecified and overly underdispersed model causes exit times to increase sharply, leading to a pronounced deterioration in sampling performance.</p></details> | 37 pages, 4 figures |

We present RMT-KD, a compression method that leverages Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for knowledge distillation to iteratively reduce network size. Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE and CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption. These results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, submitted to ICASSP 2026, September 2025</p></details> |

We propose EigenTrack, an interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier, EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling. Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, submitted to ICASSP 2026, September 2025</p></details> |
| **[Constrained Group Relative Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05863v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable framework for critic-free policy learning, extending it to settings with explicit behavioral constraints remains underexplored. We introduce Constrained GRPO, a Lagrangian-based extension of GRPO for constrained policy optimization. Constraints are specified via indicator cost functions, enabling direct optimization of violation rates through a Lagrangian relaxation. We show that a naive multi-component treatment in advantage estimation can break constrained learning: mismatched component-wise standard deviations distort the relative importance of the different objective terms, which in turn corrupts the Lagrangian signal and prevents meaningful constraint enforcement. We formally derive this effect to motivate our scalarized advantage construction that preserves the intended trade-off between reward and constraint terms. Experiments in a toy gridworld confirm the predicted optimization pathology and demonstrate that scalarizing advantages restores stable constraint control. In addition, we evaluate Constrained GRPO on robotics tasks, where it improves constraint satisfaction while increasing task success, establishing a simple and effective recipe for constrained policy optimization in embodied AI domains that increasingly rely on large multimodal foundation models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Harnessing the Unseen: The Hidden Influence of Intrinsic Knowledge in Long-Context Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08202v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in long-context language models (LCLMs), designed to handle extremely long contexts, primarily focus on utilizing external contextual information, often leaving the influence of language models' parametric knowledge underexplored. In this work, we firstly investigate how this parametric knowledge affects content generation and demonstrate that its impact becomes increasingly pronounced as context length extends. Furthermore, we show that the model's ability to utilize parametric knowledge, which we call parametric recall ability, does not improve simultaneously with its ability to leverage contextual knowledge through extrinsic retrieval ability. Moreover, better extrinsic retrieval ability can interfere with the model's parametric recall ability, limiting its full potential. To bridge this gap, we design a simple yet effective Hybrid Needle-in-a-Haystack test that evaluates models based on their capabilities across both abilities, rather than solely emphasizing extrinsic retrieval ability. Our experimental results reveal that Qwen-2.5 models significantly outperform Llama-3.1 models, demonstrating superior potential to combine various abilities. Moreover, even the more powerful Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model fails to exhibit better performance, highlighting the importance of evaluating models from a dual-ability perspective.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages,11figures (accepted to AAAI 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Detection and Analysis of Singing Mistakes for Music Pedagogy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06917v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of machine learning in audio analysis has opened new possibilities for technology-enhanced music education. This paper introduces a framework for automatic singing mistake detection in the context of music pedagogy, supported by a newly curated dataset. The dataset comprises synchronized teacher learner vocal recordings, with annotations marking different types of mistakes made by learners. Using this dataset, we develop different deep learning models for mistake detection and benchmark them. To compare the efficacy of mistake detection systems, a new evaluation methodology is proposed. Experiments indicate that the proposed learning-based methods are superior to rule-based methods. A systematic study of errors and a cross-teacher study reveal insights into music pedagogy that can be utilised for various music applications. This work sets out new directions of research in music pedagogy.

| **[Seeing Beyond Redundancy: Task Complexity's Role in Vision Token Specialization in VLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06914v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision capabilities in vision large language models (VLLMs) have consistently lagged behind their linguistic capabilities. In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights for training the next generation of VLLMs.</p></details> | 25 pages |

However, there is no standard approach to evaluate tamper resistance. Varied data sets, metrics, and tampering configurations make it difficult to compare safety, utility, and robustness across different models and defenses. To this end, we introduce TamperBench, the first unified framework to systematically evaluate the tamper resistance of LLMs. TamperBench (i) curates a repository of state-of-the-art weight-space fine-tuning attacks and latent-space representation attacks; (ii) enables realistic adversarial evaluation through systematic hyperparameter sweeps per attack-model pair; and (iii) provides both safety and utility evaluations. TamperBench requires minimal additional code to specify any fine-tuning configuration, alignment-stage defense method, and metric suite while ensuring end-to-end reproducibility. We use TamperBench to evaluate 21 open-weight LLMs, including defense-augmented variants, across nine tampering threats using standardized safety and capability metrics with hyperparameter sweeps per model-attack pair. This yields novel insights, including effects of post-training on tamper resistance, that jailbreak-tuning is typically the most severe attack, and that Triplet emerges as a leading alignment-stage defense.

| **[Encoding syntactic objects and Merge operations in function spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13501v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure. The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor function of arithmetic.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, LaTeX, 4 png figures; v2: expository changes</p></details> |
| **[Aligned Novel View Image and Geometry Synthesis via Cross-modal Attention Instillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11924v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a diffusion-based framework that performs aligned novel view image and geometry generation via a warping-and-inpainting methodology. Unlike prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry, we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for comprehensive 3D completion.

| **[ChronoRAN: Analyzing Latency in 5G Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21277v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents ChronoRAN, a mathematical framework for accurately computing one-way latency (for uplink and downlink) in the 5G RAN across diverse system configurations. ChronoRAN models latency sources at every layer of the Radio Access Network (RAN), pinpointing system-level bottlenecks--such as radio interfaces, scheduling policies, and hardware/software constraints--while capturing their intricate dependencies and their stochastic nature. ChronoRAN also includes a configuration optimizer that uses its mathematical models to search through hundreds of billions of configurations and find settings that meet latency-reliability targets under user constraints. We validate ChronoRAN on two open-sourced 5G RAN testbeds (srsRAN and OAI) and a public commercial 5G network, demonstrating that it can closely match empirical latency distributions and significantly outperform prior analytical models and widely used simulators (MATLAB 5G Toolbox, 5G-LENA). It can also find system configurations that meet Ultra-Reliable Low-Latency Communications (URLLC) targets and enable network operators to efficiently identify the best setup for their systems.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Demystifying Mergeability: Interpretable Properties to Predict Model Merging Success](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22285v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model merging combines knowledge from separately fine-tuned models, yet success factors remain poorly understood. While recent work treats mergeability as an intrinsic property, we show with an architecture-agnostic framework that it fundamentally depends on both the merging method and the partner tasks. Using linear optimization over a set of interpretable pairwise metrics (e.g., gradient L2 distance), we uncover properties correlating with post-merge performance across four merging methods. We find substantial variation in success drivers (46.7% metric overlap; 55.3% sign agreement), revealing method-specific "fingerprints". Crucially, however, subspace overlap and gradient alignment metrics consistently emerge as foundational, method-agnostic prerequisites for compatibility. These findings provide a diagnostic foundation for understanding mergeability and motivate future fine-tuning strategies that explicitly encourage these properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages of main paper, 3 figures in the main paper, 4 tables in the main paper, many more figures and tables in the appendix</p></details> |
| **[Learning a distance measure from the information-estimation geometry of data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02514v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the Information-Estimation Metric (IEM), a novel form of distance function derived from an underlying continuous probability density over a domain of signals. The IEM is rooted in a fundamental relationship between information theory and estimation theory, which links the log-probability of a signal with the errors of an optimal denoiser, applied to noisy observations of the signal. In particular, the IEM between a pair of signals is obtained by comparing their denoising error vectors over a range of noise amplitudes. Geometrically, this amounts to comparing the score vector fields of the blurred density around the signals over a range of blur levels. We prove that the IEM is a valid global distance metric and derive a closed-form expression for its local second-order approximation, which yields a Riemannian metric. For Gaussian-distributed signals, the IEM coincides with the Mahalanobis distance. But for more complex distributions, it adapts, both locally and globally, to the geometry of the distribution. In practice, the IEM can be computed using a learned denoiser (analogous to generative diffusion models) and solving a one-dimensional integral. To demonstrate the value of our framework, we learn an IEM on the ImageNet database. Experiments show that this IEM is competitive with or outperforms state-of-the-art supervised image quality metrics in predicting human perceptual judgments.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026.

While visual perception studies can complement these metrics, they often require end-to-end systems that are time-consuming to implement and setups that are difficult to reproduce. We systematically summarize key challenges in evaluating CV models and present the design of ARCADE, an evaluation platform that leverages augmented reality (AR) to enable easy, reproducible, and human-centered CV evaluation. ARCADE uses a modular architecture that provides cross-platform data collection, pluggable model inference, and interactive AR tasks, supporting both metric and visual perception evaluation. We demonstrate ARCADE through a user study with 15 participants and case studies on two representative CV tasks, depth and lighting estimation, showing that ARCADE can reveal perceptual flaws in model quality that are often missed by traditional metrics. We also evaluate ARCADE's usability and performance, showing its flexibility as a reliable real-time platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MMSys 2026</p></details> |

Among these techniques, Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) has been shown to improve both the learning capacity and training stability of the Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) method by explicitly decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and directional components. In this work, we propose DoRAN, a new technique designed to stabilize training and boost the sample efficiency of DoRA. Our framework introduces two key components: (i) the injection of learnable noise into the denominator of DoRA weight decomposition, which serves as an adaptive regularizer to mitigate instabilities and improve the estimation rate of low-rank matrices; and (ii) the replacement of static low-rank matrices with auxiliary networks that generate them dynamically, enabling parameter coupling between the query and value projection matrices, leading to improved sample efficiency both theoretically and empirically. Comprehensive experiments on vision and language benchmarks show that DoRAN consistently outperforms LoRA, DoRA, and other PEFT baselines, underscoring the effectiveness of combining noise-based regularization with network-based parameter generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Nghie...</summary><p>Nghiem T.

In this setting, we observe a prompt forgetting phenomenon: the semantics of the prompt representation in the text branch is progressively forgotten as depth increases. We further verify this effect on three representative MMDiTs--SD3, SD3.5, and FLUX.1 by probing linguistic attributes of the representations over the layers in the text branch. Motivated by these findings, we introduce a training-free approach, prompt reinjection, which reinjects prompt representations from early layers into later layers to alleviate this forgetting. Experiments on GenEval, DPG, and T2I-CompBench++ show consistent gains in instruction-following capability, along with improvements on metrics capturing preference, aesthetics, and overall text--image generation quality.</p></details> | 18 pages |

This study introduces T-STAR (Two-stage Spatial and Temporal Adaptive contextual Representation), a novel transformer-based probabilistic framework designed to forecast station-level bike-sharing demand at a 15-minute resolution. T-STAR addresses key challenges in high-resolution forecasting by disentangling consistent demand patterns from short-term fluctuations through a hierarchical two-stage structure. The first stage captures coarse-grained hourly demand patterns, while the second stage improves prediction accuracy by incorporating high-frequency, localized inputs, including recent fluctuations and real-time demand variations in connected metro services, to account for temporal shifts in short-term demand. Time series transformer models are employed in both stages to generate probabilistic predictions. Extensive experiments using Washington D.C.'s Capital Bikeshare data demonstrate that T-STAR outperforms existing methods in both deterministic and probabilistic accuracy. The model exhibits strong spatial and temporal robustness across stations and time periods. A zero-shot forecasting experiment further highlights T-STAR's ability to transfer to previously unseen service areas without retraining. These results underscore the framework's potential to deliver granular, reliable, and uncertainty-aware short-term demand forecasts, which enable seamless integration to support multimodal trip planning for travelers and enhance real-time operations in shared micro-mobility services.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to Transportation Research Part C</p></details> |

Traditional sketching tools often lose this context. We introduce DIMES (Design Idea Management and Evolution capture System), a web-based environment featuring sGIT (SketchGit), a custom visual version control architecture, and Generative AI. sGIT includes AEGIS, a module using hybrid Deep Learning and Machine Learning models to classify six stroke types. The system maps Git primitives to design actions, enabling implicit branching and multi-modal commits (stroke data + voice intent). In a comparative study, experts using DIMES demonstrated a 160% increase in breadth of concept exploration. Generative AI modules generated narrative summaries that enhanced knowledge transfer; novices achieved higher replication fidelity (Neural Transparency-based Cosine Similarity: 0.97 vs. 0.73) compared to manual summaries. AI-generated renderings also received higher user acceptance (Purchase Likelihood: 4.2 vs 3.1). This work demonstrates that intelligent version control bridges creative action and cognitive documentation, offering a new paradigm for design education.</p></details> | 49 pages, 25 figures |

However, their capacity to interpret and design antibodies through natural language remains limited. To address this challenge, we present AFD-Instruction, the first large-scale instruction dataset with functional annotations tailored to antibodies. This dataset encompasses two key components: antibody understanding, which infers functional attributes directly from sequences, and antibody design, which enables de novo sequence generation under functional constraints. These components provide explicit sequence-function alignment and support antibody design guided by natural language instructions. Extensive instruction-tuning experiments on general-purpose LLMs demonstrate that AFD-Instruction consistently improves performance across diverse antibody-related tasks. By linking antibody sequences with textual descriptions of function, AFD-Instruction establishes a new foundation for advancing antibody modeling and accelerating therapeutic discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Traditional methods for determining this characteristic are both resource-intensive and time-consuming. This study employs artificial neural networks (ANNs) to predict AC fatigue life, focusing on the impact of strain level, binder content, and air-void content. Leveraging a substantial dataset, we tailored our models to effectively handle the wide range of fatigue life data, typically represented on a logarithmic scale. The mean square logarithmic error was utilized as the loss function to enhance prediction accuracy across all levels of fatigue life. Through comparative analysis of various hyperparameters, we developed a machine-learning model that captures the complex relationships within the data. Our findings demonstrate that higher binder content significantly enhances fatigue life, while the influence of air-void content is more variable, depending on binder levels. Most importantly, this study provides insights into the intricacies of using ANNs for modeling, showcasing their potential utility with larger datasets. The codes developed and the data used in this study are provided as open source on a GitHub repository, with a link included in the paper for full access.</p></details> | Accepted paper |

| **[code_transformed: The Influence of Large Language Models on Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12014v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 20,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake_case function names in Python code increased from 40.7% in Q1 2023 to 49.8% in Q3 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Our experimental results may provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.

| **[Dataset Distillation as Pushforward Optimal Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07681v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dataset distillation aims to find a synthetic training set such that training on the synthetic data achieves similar performance to training on real data, with orders of magnitude less computational requirements. Existing methods can be broadly categorized as either bi-level optimization problems that have neural network training heuristics as the lower level problem, or disentangled methods that bypass the bi-level optimization by matching distributions of data. The latter method has the major advantages of speed and scalability in terms of size of both training and distilled datasets. We demonstrate that when equipped with an encoder-decoder structure, the empirically successful disentangled methods can be reformulated as an optimal quantization problem, where a finite set of points is found to approximate the underlying probability measure by minimizing the expected projection distance. In particular, we link existing disentangled dataset distillation methods to the classical optimal quantization and Wasserstein barycenter problems, demonstrating consistency of distilled datasets for diffusion-based generative priors. We propose Dataset Distillation by Optimal Quantization, based on clustering in a latent space. Compared to the previous SOTA method D\textsuperscript{4}M, we achieve better performance and inter-model generalization on the ImageNet-1K dataset with trivial additional computation, and SOTA performance in higher image-per-class settings. Using the distilled noise initializations in a stronger diffusion transformer model, we obtain SOTA distillation performance on ImageNet-1K and its subsets, outperforming diffusion guidance methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, https://openreview.net/forum?id=FMSp8AUF3m</p></details> |
| **[Reciprocal Latent Fields for Precomputed Sound Propagation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06937v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Realistic sound propagation is essential for immersion in a virtual scene, yet physically accurate wave-based simulations remain computationally prohibitive for real-time applications. Wave coding methods address this limitation by precomputing and compressing impulse responses of a given scene into a set of scalar acoustic parameters, which can reach unmanageable sizes in large environments with many source-receiver pairs. We introduce Reciprocal Latent Fields (RLF), a memory-efficient framework for encoding and predicting these acoustic parameters. The RLF framework employs a volumetric grid of trainable latent embeddings decoded with a symmetric function, ensuring acoustic reciprocity. We study a variety of decoders and show that leveraging Riemannian metric learning leads to a better reproduction of acoustic phenomena in complex scenes. Experimental validation demonstrates that RLF maintains replication quality while reducing the memory footprint by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, a MUSHRA-like subjective listening test indicates that sound rendered via RLF is perceptually indistinguishable from ground-truth simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Tempo...</summary><p>Temporary pre-print, will be updated.

We present RMT-KD, a compression method that leverages Random Matrix Theory (RMT) for knowledge distillation to iteratively reduce network size. Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE and CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption. These results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, submitted to ICASSP 2026, September 2025</p></details> |
| **[Seeing Beyond Redundancy: Task Complexity's Role in Vision Token Specialization in VLLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06914v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision capabilities in vision large language models (VLLMs) have consistently lagged behind their linguistic capabilities. In particular, numerous benchmark studies have demonstrated that VLLMs struggle when fine-grained visual information or spatial reasoning is required. However, we do not yet understand exactly why VLLMs struggle so much with these tasks relative to others. Some works have focused on visual redundancy as an explanation, where high-level visual information is uniformly spread across numerous tokens and specific, fine-grained visual information is discarded. In this work, we investigate this premise in greater detail, seeking to better understand exactly how various types of visual information are processed by the model and what types of visual information are discarded. To do so, we introduce a simple synthetic benchmark dataset that is specifically constructed to probe various visual features, along with a set of metrics for measuring visual redundancy, allowing us to better understand the nuances of their relationship. Then, we explore fine-tuning VLLMs on a number of complex visual tasks to better understand how redundancy and compression change based upon the complexity of the data that a model is trained on. We find that there is a connection between task complexity and visual compression, implying that having a sufficient ratio of high complexity visual data is crucial for altering the way that VLLMs distribute their visual representation and consequently improving their performance on complex visual tasks. We hope that this work will provide valuable insights for training the next generation of VLLMs.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Encoding syntactic objects and Merge operations in function spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13501v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a mathematical argument showing that, given a representation of lexical items as functions (wavelets, for instance) in some function space, it is possible to construct a faithful representation of arbitrary syntactic objects in the same function space. This space can be endowed with a commutative non-associative semiring structure built using the second Renyi entropy. The resulting representation of syntactic objects is compatible with the magma structure. The resulting set of functions is an algebra over an operad, where the operations in the operad model circuits that transform the input wave forms into a combined output that encodes the syntactic structure. The action of Merge on workspaces is faithfully implemented as action on these circuits, through a coproduct and a Hopf algebra Markov chain. The results obtained here provide a constructive argument showing the theoretical possibility of a neurocomputational realization of the core computational structure of syntax. We also present a particular case of this general construction where this type of realization of Merge is implemented as a cross frequency phase synchronization on sinusoidal waves. This also shows that Merge can be expressed in terms of the successor function of a semiring, thus clarifying the well known observation of its similarities with the successor function of arithmetic.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, LaTeX, 4 png figures; v2: expository changes</p></details> |

However, in practical deployments, device heterogeneity, non-independent, and identically distributed (Non-IID) data often lead to highly unstable and biased gradient updates. When differential privacy is enforced, conventional fixed gradient clipping and Gaussian noise injection may further amplify gradient perturbations, resulting in training oscillation and performance degradation and degraded model performance. To address these challenges, we propose an adaptive differentially private federated learning framework that explicitly targets model efficiency under heterogeneous and privacy-constrained settings. On the client side, a lightweight local compressed module is introduced to regularize intermediate representations and constrain gradient variability, thereby mitigating noise amplification during local optimization. On the server side, an adaptive gradient clipping strategy dynamically adjusts clipping thresholds based on historical update statistics to avoid over-clipping and noise domination. Furthermore, a constraint-aware aggregation mechanism is designed to suppress unreliable or noise-dominated client updates and stabilize global optimization. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and SVHN demonstrate improved convergence stability and classification accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submited to a conference</p></details> |

We introduce new gradient flows of the KL divergence with a remarkable combination of properties: they admit accurate interacting-particle approximations in high dimensions, and the per-step cost scales linearly in both the number of particles and the dimension. These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections. This yields interacting-particle-based algorithms whose per-step cost follows from efficient Fast Fourier Transform-based evaluation of the required 1D convolutions. We additionally provide numerical experiments that study the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare convergence behavior and quantization. Finally, we prove some theoretical results including well-posedness of the flows and long-time convergence guarantees for the RRW flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 7 figures; corrected Figure 4.4</p></details> |

A rich, largely untapped resource lies in non-Hermitian quantum physics, where the energy spectra of crystals form intricate geometries on the complex plane -- termed as Hamiltonian spectral graphs. Despite their significance as fingerprints for electronic behavior, their systematic study has been intractable due to the reliance on manual extraction. To unlock this potential, we introduce Poly2Graph: a high-performance, open-source pipeline that automates the mapping of 1-D crystal Hamiltonians to spectral graphs. Using this tool, we present HSG-12M: a dataset containing 11.6 million static and 5.1 million dynamic Hamiltonian spectral graphs across 1401 characteristic-polynomial classes, distilled from 177 TB of spectral potential data. Crucially, HSG-12M is the first large-scale dataset of spatial multigraphs -- graphs embedded in a metric space where multiple geometrically distinct trajectories between two nodes are retained as separate edges. This simultaneously addresses a critical gap, as existing graph benchmarks overwhelmingly assume simple, non-spatial edges, discarding vital geometric information. Benchmarks with popular GNNs expose new challenges in learning spatial multi-edges at scale. Beyond its practical utility, we show that spectral graphs serve as universal topological fingerprints of polynomials, vectors, and matrices, forging a new algebra-to-graph link. HSG-12M lays the groundwork for data-driven scientific discovery in condensed matter physics, new opportunities in geometry-aware graph learning and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>48 pa...</summary><p>48 pages, 13 figures, 14 tables.

This survey advances a unique pipeline-centric view that spans from corpus curation and pretraining, through domain adaptation and instruction tuning, to goal-conditioned agents interfacing with simulation and experimental platforms. Unlike prior reviews, we treat the entire process as an end-to-end system to be optimized for tangible discovery outcomes rather than proxy benchmarks. This perspective allows us to trace how upstream design choices-such as data curation and training objectives-can be aligned with downstream experimental success through effective credit assignment. To bridge communities and establish a shared frame of reference, we first present an integrated lens that aligns terminology, evaluation, and workflow stages across AI and materials science. We then analyze the field through two focused lenses: From the AI perspective, the survey details LLM strengths in pattern recognition, predictive analytics, and natural language processing for literature mining, materials characterization, and property prediction; from the materials science perspective, it highlights applications in materials design, process optimization, and the acceleration of computational workflows via integration with external tools (e.g., DFT, robotic labs). Finally, we contrast passive, reactive approaches with agentic design, cataloging current contributions while motivating systems that pursue long-horizon goals with autonomy, memory, and tool use. This survey charts a practical roadmap towards autonomous, safety-aware LLM agents aimed at discovering novel and useful materials.</p></details> | 81 pages |

Across three standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of Superposition (TMS), a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition and a 1-layer Transformer trained on modular addition, we find that top eigenspaces of the eNTK align with ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic, the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that the evolution of the eNTK spectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small models.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 figures. v2: references and expanded discussion in Appendix B added. v3: Transformer case study and more appendices added</p></details> |

Compressed sensing finds applications in critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with $l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method. Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2025</p></details> |
| **[Explaining Grokking in Transformers through the Lens of Inductive Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06702v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate grokking in transformers through the lens of inductive bias: dispositions arising from architecture or optimization that let the network prefer one solution over another. We first show that architectural choices such as the position of Layer Normalization (LN) strongly modulates grokking speed. This modulation is explained by isolating how LN on specific pathways shapes shortcut-learning and attention entropy. Subsequently, we study how different optimization settings modulate grokking, inducing distinct interpretations of previously proposed controls such as readout scale. Particularly, we find that using readout scale as a control for lazy training can be confounded by learning rate and weight decay in our setting. Accordingly, we show that features evolve continuously throughout training, suggesting grokking in transformers can be more nuanced than a lazy-to-rich transition of the learning regime. Finally, we show how generalization predictably emerges with feature compressibility in grokking, across different modulators of inductive bias.

At variance with previous approaches, our QSA realizes the required nonlinearity through interference of state overlaps and returns a Renyi-1/2 cross-entropy loss directly as the expectation value of an observable, avoiding the need to decode amplitude-encoded predictions into classical logits. Furthermore, QSA naturally accommodates a constrained, trainable data-embedding that ties quantum state overlaps to data-level similarities. We find a gate complexity dominant scaling O(T d^2) for QSA, versus O(T^2 d) classically, suggesting an advantage in the practical regime where the sequence length T dominates the embedding size d. In simulations, we show that our QSA-based quantum transformer learns sequence prediction on classical data and on many-body transverse-field Ising quantum trajectories, establishing trainable attention as a practical primitive for quantum dynamical modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 + 1...</summary><p>4 + 1 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand. The developed algorithm and the proposed sampling distributions are evaluated in two simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |
| **[NanoQuant: Efficient Sub-1-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06694v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Weight-only quantization has become a standard approach for efficiently serving large language models (LLMs). However, existing methods fail to efficiently compress models to binary (1-bit) levels, as they either require large amounts of data and compute or incur additional storage. In this work, we propose NanoQuant, the first post-training quantization (PTQ) method to compress LLMs to both binary and sub-1-bit levels. NanoQuant formulates quantization as a low-rank binary factorization problem, and compresses full-precision weights to low-rank binary matrices and scales. Specifically, it utilizes an efficient alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) method to precisely initialize latent binary matrices and scales, and then tune the initialized parameters through a block and model reconstruction process. Consequently, NanoQuant establishes a new Pareto frontier in low-memory post-training quantization, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy even at sub-1-bit compression rates. NanoQuant makes large-scale deployment feasible on consumer hardware. For example, it compresses Llama2-70B by 25.8$\times$ in just 13 hours on a single H100, enabling a 70B model to operate on a consumer 8 GB GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages.

To bridge this gap, we introduce MapFormers, new architectures based on Transformer models, which can learn cognitive maps from observational data and perform path integration in parallel, in a self-supervised manner. Cognitive maps are learned in the model by disentangling structural relationships in the inputs from their specific content, a property that can be achieved naturally by updating the positional encoding in Transformers with input-dependent matrices. We developed two variants of MapFormers that unify absolute and relative positional encoding to model episodic (EM) and working memory (WM), respectively. We tested MapFormers on several tasks, including a classic 2D navigation task, showing that our models can learn a cognitive map of the underlying space and generalize OOD (e.g., to longer sequences) with near-perfect performance, unlike current architectures. Together, these results demonstrate the superiority of models designed to learn a cognitive map, and the importance of introducing a structural bias for structure-content disentanglement, which can be achieved in Transformers with input-dependent positional encoding. MapFormers have broad applications in both neuroscience and AI, by explaining the neural mechanisms giving rise to cognitive maps, while allowing these relation models to be learned at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages (29 with appendix), 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Multi-Order Wavelet Derivative Transform for Deep Time Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11781v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In deep time series forecasting, the Fourier Transform (FT) is extensively employed for frequency representation learning. However, it often struggles in capturing multi-scale, time-sensitive patterns. Although the Wavelet Transform (WT) can capture these patterns through frequency decomposition, its coefficients are insensitive to change points in time series, leading to suboptimal modeling. To mitigate these limitations, we introduce the multi-order Wavelet Derivative Transform (WDT) grounded in the WT, enabling the extraction of time-aware patterns spanning both the overall trend and subtle fluctuations. Compared with the standard FT and WT, which model the raw series, the WDT operates on the derivative of the series, selectively magnifying rate-of-change cues and exposing abrupt regime shifts that are particularly informative for time series modeling. Practically, we embed the WDT into a multi-branch framework named WaveTS, which decomposes the input series into multi-scale time-frequency coefficients, refines them via linear layers, and reconstructs them into the time domain via the inverse WDT. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that WaveTS achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy while retaining high computational efficiency.</p></details> | Preprint |

We propose a unified pre-training and fine-tuning pipeline for traffic foundation models. Through fine-tuning, we demonstrate the generalizability of the traffic foundation models in various downstream tasks, including traffic classification, traffic characteristic prediction, and traffic generation. We also compare against non-foundation baselines, demonstrating that the foundation-model backbones achieve improved performance. Moreover, we categorize existing models based on their architecture, input modality, and pre-training strategy. Our findings show that these models can effectively learn traffic representations and perform well with limited labeled datasets, highlighting their potential in future intelligent network analysis systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Communications Magazine</p></details> |

Using a detailed dataset of toy cars on textit{Amazon.com}, we combine text descriptions, images, and tabular covariates to represent each product using transformer-based embedding models. These embeddings capture nuanced attributes, such as quality, branding, and visual characteristics, that traditional methods often struggle to summarize. Moreover, we fine-tune these embeddings for causal inference tasks. We show that the resulting embeddings substantially improve the predictive accuracy of sales ranks and prices and that they lead to more credible causal estimates of price elasticity. Notably, we uncover strong heterogeneity in price elasticity driven by these product-specific features. Our findings illustrate that AI-driven representations can enrich and modernize empirical demand analysis. The insights generated may also prove valuable for applied causal inference more broadly.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |

By exploiting architectural properties of ViTs, DAVE isolates locally equivariant and stable components of the effective input--output mapping.

The security analysis of LEO constellations faces a fundamental paradigm gap: traditional topology-centric methods fail to capture systemic risks arising from dynamic load imbalances and high-order dependencies, which can transform localized failures into network-wide cascades. To address this, we propose HYDRA, a hypergraph-based dynamic risk analysis framework. Its core is a novel metric, Hyper-Bridge Centrality (HBC), which quantifies node criticality via a load-to-redundancy ratio within dependency structures. A primary challenge to resilience: the most critical vulnerabilities are not in the densely connected satellite core, but in the seemingly marginal ground-space interfaces. These are the system's "Black Swan" nodes--topologically peripheral yet structurally lethal. We validate this through extensive simulations using realistic StarLink TLE data and population-based gravity model. Experiments demonstrate that HBC consistently outperforms traditional metrics, identifying critical failure points that surpass the structural damage potential of even betweenness centrality. This work shifts the security paradigm from connectivity to structural stress, demonstrating that securing the network edge is paramount and necessitates a fundamental redesign of redundancy strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures, USENIX Security</p></details> |

However, its effectiveness depends critically on the quality and diversity of training data. In this work, we show how classical geometric planners can be leveraged to generate synthetic trajectories that complement costly human demonstrations. We train Less is More (LiMo), a transformer-based visual navigation policy that predicts goal-conditioned SE(2) trajectories from a single RGB observation, and find that augmenting limited expert demonstrations with planner-generated supervision yields substantial performance gains. Through ablations and complementary qualitative and quantitative analyses, we characterize how dataset scale and diversity affect planning performance. We demonstrate real-robot deployment and argue that robust visual navigation is enabled not by simply collecting more demonstrations, but by strategically curating diverse, high-quality datasets. Our results suggest that scalable, embodiment-specific geometric supervision is a practical path toward data-efficient visual navigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: M...</summary><p>v2: Minor text edits, reference formatting fixes, and project page link added</p></details> |

Self-supervised learning (SSL) can mitigate this by pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, but it remains unclear how well such representations transfer across microscopy domains with different staining protocols and channel configurations. We investigate the cross-domain transferability of DINO-pretrained Vision Transformers for protein localization on the OpenCell dataset. We generate image embeddings using three DINO backbones pretrained on ImageNet-1k, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and OpenCell, and evaluate them by training a supervised classification head on OpenCell labels. All pretrained models transfer well, with the microscopy-specific HPA-pretrained model achieving the best performance (mean macro $F_1$-score = 0.8221 $\pm$ 0.0062), slightly outperforming a DINO model trained directly on OpenCell (0.8057 $\pm$ 0.0090). These results highlight the value of large-scale pretraining and indicate that domain-relevant SSL representations can generalize effectively to related but distinct microscopy datasets, enabling strong downstream performance even when task-specific labeled data are limited.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint; not yet peer reviewed.

Recent studies have highlighted two pivotal properties for effective representations: (i) avoiding dimensional collapse-where the learned features occupy only a low-dimensional subspace, and (ii) enhancing uniformity of the induced distribution. In this work, we introduce T-REGS, a simple regularization framework for SSL based on the length of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) over the learned representation. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating that T-REGS simultaneously mitigates dimensional collapse and promotes distribution uniformity on arbitrary compact Riemannian manifolds. Several experiments on synthetic data and on classical SSL benchmarks validate the effectiveness of our approach at enhancing representation quality.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Most existing methods rely on a mask-based training strategy, where the mouth region is masked in talking-head videos, and the model learns to synthesize lip movements from corrupted inputs and target audios. While this facilitates lip-sync accuracy, it disrupts spatiotemporal context, impairing performance on dynamic facial motions and causing instability in facial structure and background consistency. To overcome this limitation, we propose SyncAnyone, a novel two-stage learning framework that achieves accurate motion modeling and high visual fidelity simultaneously. In Stage 1, we train a diffusion-based video transformer for masked mouth inpainting, leveraging its strong spatiotemporal modeling to generate accurate, audio-driven lip movements. However, due to input corruption, minor artifacts may arise in the surrounding facial regions and the background. In Stage 2, we develop a mask-free tuning pipeline to address mask-induced artifacts. Specifically, on the basis of the Stage 1 model, we develop a data generation pipeline that creates pseudo-paired training samples by synthesizing lip-synced videos from the source video and random sampled audio. We further tune the stage 2 model on this synthetic data, achieving precise lip editing and better background consistency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in visual quality, temporal coherence, and identity preservation under in-the wild lip-syncing scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://humanaigc.github.io/sync_anyone_demo_page/</p></details> |

While these models can simulate realistic visual outcomes, they often exhibit poor action-following precision, hindering their utility for downstream robotic learning. In this work, we introduce World-VLA-Loop, a closed-loop framework for the joint refinement of world models and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) policies. We propose a state-aware video world model that functions as a high-fidelity interactive simulator by jointly predicting future observations and reward signals. To enhance reliability, we introduce the SANS dataset, which incorporates near-success trajectories to improve action-outcome alignment within the world model. This framework enables a closed-loop for reinforcement learning (RL) post-training of VLA policies entirely within a virtual environment. Crucially, our approach facilitates a co-evolving cycle: failure rollouts generated by the VLA policy are iteratively fed back to refine the world model precision, which in turn enhances subsequent RL optimization. Evaluations across simulation and real-world tasks demonstrate that our framework significantly boosts VLA performance with minimal physical interaction, establishing a mutually beneficial relationship between world modeling and policy learning for general-purpose robotics.

In this work, we argue that its full self-attention design is suboptimal, suffering from quadratic complexity with respect to the number of input views and rigid parameter sharing among heterogeneous tokens. We propose Efficient-LVSM, a dual-stream architecture that avoids these issues with a decoupled co-refinement mechanism. It applies intra-view self-attention for input views and self-then-cross attention for target views, eliminating unnecessary computation. Efficient-LVSM achieves 29.86 dB PSNR on RealEstate10K with 2 input views, surpassing LVSM by 0.2 dB, with 2x faster training convergence and 4.4x faster inference speed.

It is known that the rate-distortion function (RDF) is lower-bounded by the rate derived from the Hadamard inequality, which becomes exact when the semidefinite condition (SDC) holds. However, existing works often overlook the case where the SDC is not satisfied. Moreover, even when the SDC holds, a quantitative characterization of how correlations enable more efficient compression is lacking. In this work, we refine the results when the SDC is satisfied and derive new theoretical results when the SDC is not satisfied, thereby establishing theoretical limits for practical source compression with correlations. Specifically, we examine the properties of optimal source reconstruction and provide upper bounds on its dimension, showing that lower-dimensional reconstructions are essential for efficient compression when the SDC does not hold. Within a scalable two-type correlation (2TC) covariance framework, we prove that the probability of satisfying the SDC decays exponentially with source length, emphasizing the importance of exploring theoretical limits when the SDC is not met. Additional, we determine the component-wise correlations that a vector source should possess to achieve the Hadamard compression rate, revealing the trade-off between distortion constraints and correlations. More importantly, by deriving an explicit RDF with correlations incorporated, we quantitatively characterize the gain in compression efficiency achieved by fully leveraging source correlations.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in IEEE GLOBECOM 2025</p></details> |

Iterative reasoning mitigates these issues by periodically summarizing intermediate thoughts, yet existing methods rely on supervised learning or fixed heuristics and fail to optimize when to summarize, what to preserve, and how to resume reasoning. We propose InftyThink+, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that optimizes the entire iterative reasoning trajectory, building on model-controlled iteration boundaries and explicit summarization. InftyThink+ adopts a two-stage training scheme with supervised cold-start followed by trajectory-level reinforcement learning, enabling the model to learn strategic summarization and continuation decisions. Experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B show that InftyThink+ improves accuracy by 21% on AIME24 and outperforms conventional long chain-of-thought reinforcement learning by a clear margin, while also generalizing better to out-of-distribution benchmarks. Moreover, InftyThink+ significantly reduces inference latency and accelerates reinforcement learning training, demonstrating improved reasoning efficiency alongside stronger performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zju-real.github.io/InftyThink-Plus Code: https://github.com/ZJU-REAL/InftyThink-Plus</p></details> |

Unlike prior methods that require dense posed images or pose-embedded generative models limited to in-domain views, our method leverages off-the-shelf geometry predictors to predict partial geometries viewed from reference images, and formulates novel-view synthesis as an inpainting task for both image and geometry. To ensure accurate alignment between generated images and geometry, we propose cross-modal attention distillation, where attention maps from the image diffusion branch are injected into a parallel geometry diffusion branch during both training and inference. This multi-task approach achieves synergistic effects, facilitating geometrically robust image synthesis as well as well-defined geometry prediction. We further introduce proximity-based mesh conditioning to integrate depth and normal cues, interpolating between point cloud and filtering erroneously predicted geometry from influencing the generation process. Empirically, our method achieves high-fidelity extrapolative view synthesis on both image and geometry across a range of unseen scenes, delivers competitive reconstruction quality under interpolation settings, and produces geometrically aligned colored point clouds for comprehensive 3D completion.

While visual perception studies can complement these metrics, they often require end-to-end systems that are time-consuming to implement and setups that are difficult to reproduce. We systematically summarize key challenges in evaluating CV models and present the design of ARCADE, an evaluation platform that leverages augmented reality (AR) to enable easy, reproducible, and human-centered CV evaluation. ARCADE uses a modular architecture that provides cross-platform data collection, pluggable model inference, and interactive AR tasks, supporting both metric and visual perception evaluation. We demonstrate ARCADE through a user study with 15 participants and case studies on two representative CV tasks, depth and lighting estimation, showing that ARCADE can reveal perceptual flaws in model quality that are often missed by traditional metrics. We also evaluate ARCADE's usability and performance, showing its flexibility as a reliable real-time platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MMSys 2026</p></details> |

We introduce Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL), a modular architecture that explicitly separates agent cognition into five phases: Retrieval, Cognition, Control, Action, and Memory (R-CCAM). Soft Symbolic Control constitutes a dedicated governance layer within SCL, applying symbolic constraints to probabilistic inference while preserving the flexibility of neural reasoning and restoring the explainability and controllability of classical symbolic systems. Through empirical validation on multi-step conditional reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that SCL achieves zero policy violations, eliminates redundant tool calls, and maintains complete decision traceability. These results address critical gaps in existing frameworks such as ReAct, AutoGPT, and memory-augmented approaches. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we situate SCL within the taxonomy of hybrid intelligence, differentiating it from prompt-centric and memory-only approaches; (2) we formally define Soft Symbolic Control and contrast it with neuro-symbolic AI; and (3) we derive three design principles for trustworthy agents: modular decomposition, adaptive symbolic governance, and transparent state management. We provide a complete open-source implementation demonstrating the R-CCAM loop architecture, alongside a live GPT-4o-powered travel planning agent. By connecting expert system principles with modern LLM capabilities, this work offers a practical and theoretically grounded path toward reliable, explainable, and governable AI agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This revised version strengthens the architectural clarity and conceptual coherence of the manuscript.

Despite this empirical success, its convergence properties are not well understood. In this paper, we bridge the gap by providing convergence guarantees for multicalibration gradient boosting in regression with squared-error loss. We show that the magnitude of successive prediction updates decays at $O(1/\sqrt{T})$, which implies the same convergence rate bound for the multicalibration error over rounds. Under additional smoothness assumptions on the weak learners, this rate improves to linear convergence. We further analyze adaptive variants, showing local quadratic convergence of the training loss, and we study rescaling schemes that preserve convergence. Experiments on real-world datasets support our theory and clarify the regimes in which the method achieves fast convergence and strong multicalibration.</p></details> | Under submission |
| **[Radon--Wasserstein Gradient Flows for Interacting-Particle Sampling in High Dimensions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05227v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient flows of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence, such as the Fokker--Planck equation and Stein Variational Gradient Descent, evolve a distribution toward a target density known only up to a normalizing constant. We introduce new gradient flows of the KL divergence with a remarkable combination of properties: they admit accurate interacting-particle approximations in high dimensions, and the per-step cost scales linearly in both the number of particles and the dimension. These gradient flows are based on new transportation-based Riemannian geometries on the space of probability measures: the Radon--Wasserstein geometry and the related Regularized Radon--Wasserstein (RRW) geometry. We define these geometries using the Radon transform so that the gradient-flow velocities depend only on one-dimensional projections. This yields interacting-particle-based algorithms whose per-step cost follows from efficient Fast Fourier Transform-based evaluation of the required 1D convolutions. We additionally provide numerical experiments that study the performance of the proposed algorithms and compare convergence behavior and quantization. Finally, we prove some theoretical results including well-posedness of the flows and long-time convergence guarantees for the RRW flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 7 figures; corrected Figure 4.4</p></details> |

Among standard imaging planes, the four-chamber (4CH) view provides comprehensive information for CHD diagnosis, where clinicians carefully inspect the end-diastolic (ED) and end-systolic (ES) phases to evaluate cardiac structure and motion. Automated detection of these cardiac phases is thus a critical component toward fully automated CHD analysis. Yet, in the absence of fetal electrocardiography (ECG), manual identification of ED and ES frames remains a labor-intensive bottleneck. We present ORBIT (Orientation-Robust Beat Inference from Trajectories), a self-supervised framework that identifies cardiac phases without manual annotations under various fetal heart orientation. ORBIT employs registration as self-supervision task and learns a latent motion trajectory of cardiac deformation, whose turning points capture transitions between cardiac relaxation and contraction, enabling accurate and orientation-robust localization of ED and ES frames across diverse fetal positions. Trained exclusively on normal fetal echocardiography videos, ORBIT achieves consistent performance on both normal (MAE = 1.9 frames for ED and 1.6 for ES) and CHD cases (MAE = 2.4 frames for ED and 2.1 for ES), outperforming existing annotation-free approaches constrained by fixed orientation assumptions. These results highlight the potential of ORBIT to facilitate robust cardiac phase detection directly from 4CH fetal echocardiography.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, Submitted to a journal</p></details> |

To meet these challenges, this paper integrates echo-state networks (ESNs)--reservoir computing models implemented with recurrent neural networks--and model predictive path integral (MPPI) control--sampling-based variants of model predictive control. The proposed reservoir predictive path integral (RPPI) enables fast learning of nonlinear dynamics with ESNs and exploits the learned nonlinearities directly in MPPI control computation without linearization approximations. This framework is further extended to uncertainty-aware RPPI (URPPI), which achieves robust stochastic control by treating ESN output weights as random variables and minimizing an expected cost over their distribution to account for identification errors. Experiments on controlling a Duffing oscillator and a four-tank system demonstrate that URPPI improves control performance, reducing control costs by up to 60% compared to traditional quadratic programming-based model predictive control methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication, 13 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Compressed sensing finds applications in critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with $l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method. Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS2025</p></details> |

Moreover, ensuring that robot trajectories are similar to how a human moves will increase the acceptance of the robot in human environments. In this paper, we present Crowd-FM, a learning-based approach to address both safety and human-likeness challenges. Our approach has two novel components. First, we train a Conditional Flow-Matching (CFM) policy over a dataset of optimally controlled trajectories to learn a set of collision-free primitives that a robot can choose at any given scenario. The chosen optimal control solver can generate multi-modal collision-free trajectories, allowing the CFM policy to learn a diverse set of maneuvers. Secondly, we learn a score function over a dataset of human demonstration trajectories that provides a human-likeness score for the flow primitives. At inference time, computing the optimal trajectory requires selecting the one with the highest score. Our approach improves the state-of-the-art by showing that our CFM policy alone can produce collision-free navigation with a higher success rate than existing learning-based baselines. Furthermore, when augmented with inference-time refinement, our approach can outperform even expensive optimisation-based planning approaches. Finally, we validate that our scoring network can select trajectories closer to the expert data than a manually designed cost function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICRA 2026.

Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand. The developed algorithm and the proposed sampling distributions are evaluated in two simulation scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be published as part of the 2024 IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Jeju Shinhwa World, Jeju Island, Korea, June 2-5, 2024</p></details> |
| **[ReflexFlow: Rethinking Learning Objective for Exposure Bias Alleviation in Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04904v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite tremendous recent progress, Flow Matching methods still suffer from exposure bias due to discrepancies in training and inference. This paper investigates the root causes of exposure bias in Flow Matching, including: (1) the model lacks generalization to biased inputs during training, and (2) insufficient low-frequency content captured during early denoising, leading to accumulated bias. Based on these insights, we propose ReflexFlow, a simple and effective reflexive refinement of the Flow Matching learning objective that dynamically corrects exposure bias. ReflexFlow consists of two components: (1) Anti-Drift Rectification (ADR), which reflexively adjusts prediction targets for biased inputs utilizing a redesigned loss under training-time scheduled sampling; and (2) Frequency Compensation (FC), which reflects on missing low-frequency components and compensates them by reweighting the loss using exposure bias. ReflexFlow is model-agnostic, compatible with all Flow Matching frameworks, and improves generation quality across datasets. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, and ImageNet-256 show that ReflexFlow outperforms prior approaches in mitigating exposure bias, achieving a 35.65% reduction in FID on CelebA-64.</p></details> | <details><summary>After...</summary><p>After careful consideration, we have decided to withdraw our submission for substantial revisions.

| **[Not All Layers Need Tuning: Selective Layer Restoration Recovers Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06665v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training improves instruction-following and helpfulness of large language models (LLMs) but often reduces generation diversity, which leads to repetitive outputs in open-ended settings, a phenomenon known as mode collapse. Motivated by evidence that LLM layers play distinct functional roles, we hypothesize that mode collapse can be localized to specific layers and that restoring a carefully chosen range of layers to their pre-trained weights can recover diversity while maintaining high output quality. To validate this hypothesis and decide which layers to restore, we design a proxy task -- Constrained Random Character(CRC) -- with an explicit validity set and a natural diversity objective. Results on CRC reveal a clear diversity-validity trade-off across restoration ranges and identify configurations that increase diversity with minimal quality loss. Based on these findings, we propose Selective Layer Restoration (SLR), a training-free method that restores selected layers in a post-trained model to their pre-trained weights, yielding a hybrid model with the same architecture and parameter count, incurring no additional inference cost. Across three different tasks (creative writing, open-ended question answering, and multi-step reasoning) and three different model families (Llama, Qwen, and Gemma), we find SLR can consistently and substantially improve output diversity while maintaining high output quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adventures in Demand Analysis Using AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00382v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper advances empirical demand analysis by integrating multimodal product representations derived from artificial intelligence (AI). Using a detailed dataset of toy cars on textit{Amazon.com}, we combine text descriptions, images, and tabular covariates to represent each product using transformer-based embedding models. These embeddings capture nuanced attributes, such as quality, branding, and visual characteristics, that traditional methods often struggle to summarize. Moreover, we fine-tune these embeddings for causal inference tasks. We show that the resulting embeddings substantially improve the predictive accuracy of sales ranks and prices and that they lead to more credible causal estimates of price elasticity. Notably, we uncover strong heterogeneity in price elasticity driven by these product-specific features. Our findings illustrate that AI-driven representations can enrich and modernize empirical demand analysis. The insights generated may also prove valuable for applied causal inference more broadly.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |
| **[TrapSuffix: Proactive Defense Against Adversarial Suffixes in Jailbreaking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06630v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Suffix-based jailbreak attacks append an adversarial suffix, i.e., a short token sequence, to steer aligned LLMs into unsafe outputs. Since suffixes are free-form text, they admit endlessly many surface forms, making jailbreak mitigation difficult. Most existing defenses depend on passive detection of suspicious suffixes, without leveraging the defender's inherent asymmetric ability to inject secrets and proactively conceal gaps. Motivated by this, we take a controllability-oriented perspective and develop a proactive defense that nudges attackers into a no-win dilemma: either they fall into defender-designed optimization traps and fail to produce an effective adversarial suffix, or they can succeed only by generating adversarial suffixes that carry distinctive, traceable fingerprints. We propose TrapSuffix, a lightweight fine-tuning approach that injects trap-aligned behaviors into the base model without changing the inference pipeline. TrapSuffix channels jailbreak attempts into these two outcomes by reshaping the model's response landscape to adversarial suffixes. Across diverse suffix-based jailbreak settings, TrapSuffix reduces the average attack success rate to below 0.01 percent and achieves an average tracing success rate of 87.9 percent, providing both strong defense and reliable traceability. It introduces no inference-time overhead and incurs negligible memory cost, requiring only 15.87 MB of additional memory on average, whereas state-of-the-art LLM-based detection defenses typically incur memory overheads at the 1e4 MB level, while composing naturally with existing filtering-based defenses for complementary protection.</p></details> | 23 pages, 11 figures |
| **[LeWiDi-2025 at NLPerspectives: Third Edition of the Learning with Disagreements Shared Task](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08460v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many researchers have reached the conclusion that AI models should be trained to be aware of the possibility of variation and disagreement in human judgments, and evaluated as per their ability to recognize such variation. The LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators. Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages; LeWiDi-2025 shared task description paper at NLPerspective workshop at EMNLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Cost-Effective Near-Storage Processing Solution for Offline Inference of Long-Context LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09921v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The computational and memory demands of large language models for generative inference present significant challenges for practical deployment. One promising solution targeting offline inference is offloading-based batched inference, which extends the GPU's memory hierarchy with host memory and storage. However, it often suffers from substantial I/O overhead, primarily due to the large KV cache sizes that scale with batch size and context window length. In this paper, we introduce HILOS, a framework that boosts offline inference throughput using near-storage processing. The core of HILOS is attention near storage, which offloads memory-intensive attention operations to near-storage accelerators, reducing traffic across the system interconnect. Building on attention near storage, HILOS incorporates three additional optimizations. First, cooperative X-cache minimizes KV cache I/O by exploiting available host resources after offloading. Second, delayed KV cache writeback hides storage write latency and mitigates storage write amplification. Finally, a memory-efficient attention accelerator sustains high throughput for long sequences within the resource constraints of NSP devices. We implemented and evaluated HILOS on a real system equipped with 16 SmartSSDs. Compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based inference frameworks, HILOS achieves up to 7.86x throughput while reducing energy consumption by up to 85\%. The source code for HILOS is available at https://github.com/hongsunjang/HILOS.</p></details> | ASPLOS'26 |
| **[DualMap: Enabling Both Cache Affinity and Load Balancing for Distributed LLM Serving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06502v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In LLM serving, reusing the KV cache of prompts across requests is critical for reducing TTFT and serving costs. Cache-affinity scheduling, which co-locates requests with the same prompt prefix to maximize KV cache reuse, often conflicts with load-balancing scheduling that distributes requests evenly across compute instances. Existing schedulers fail to reconcile this trade-off as they operate within a single mapping space, typically applying cache-affinity routing to a subset of requests and load-balanced routing to the rest, without a unified solution to achieve both goals. To address this limitation, we propose DualMap, a dual-mapping scheduling strategy for distributed LLM serving that achieves both cache affinity and load balancing. Its key idea is to map each request to two candidate instances via two independent hash functions based on the request prompt, then intelligently select the better candidate based on current system states. This design increases the likelihood that requests with shared prefixes are co-located, while evenly dispersing distinct prefixes across the cluster via ``the power of two choices''. To make DualMap robust under dynamic and skewed real-world workloads, we incorporate three techniques: 1) SLO-aware request routing, which prioritizes cache affinity but switches to load-aware scheduling when TTFT exceeds the SLO, enhancing load balance without sacrificing cache reuse; 2) hotspot-aware rebalancing, which dynamically migrates requests from overloaded to underloaded instances, mitigating hotspots and rebalancing the system; 3) lightweight dual-hash-ring scaling, which leverages a dual-hash-ring mapping to support fast and low-overhead instance scaling without costly global remapping. Experiments on real-world workloads show that DualMap improves effective request capacity by up to 2.25$\times$ under the same TTFT SLO constraints compared with SOTA work.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |
| **[FCDP: Fully Cached Data Parallel for Communication-Avoiding Large-Scale Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06499v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training billion-parameter models requires distributing model states across GPUs using fully sharded data parallel (i.e., ZeRO-3). While ZeRO-3 succeeds on clusters with high-bandwidth NVLink and InfiniBand interconnects, researchers with commodity hardware face severe inter-node all-gather bottlenecks. Existing optimizations take two approaches: GPU memory caching (MiCS, ZeRO++) trades memory capacity for reduced communication, triggering out-of-memory failures on large models; host memory offloading (ZeRO-Offload, ZeRO-Infinity) extends capacity but degrades throughput due to PCIe overhead. We observe that on bandwidth-limited clusters, host memory can serve not as an overflow tier but as a fast caching layer that outperforms inter-node communication. Based on this insight, we propose FCDP, which eliminates redundant inter-node communication while preserving ZeRO-3's minimal GPU memory footprint. FCDP caches forward-pass parameters in host memory and reuses them during the backward pass via fast intra-node all-gather, reducing inter-node all-gather by 50%. For parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), FCDP selectively communicates only trainable parameters to maximize caching, reducing inter-node traffic by over 99%. In our commodity cluster setup, FCDP achieves up to 100x higher throughput than ZeRO-3 and 51x higher than ZeRO++, while maintaining ZeRO-3's maximum batch size.</p></details> | 14 pages,10 figures |

In this work, we argue that its full self-attention design is suboptimal, suffering from quadratic complexity with respect to the number of input views and rigid parameter sharing among heterogeneous tokens. We propose Efficient-LVSM, a dual-stream architecture that avoids these issues with a decoupled co-refinement mechanism. It applies intra-view self-attention for input views and self-then-cross attention for target views, eliminating unnecessary computation. Efficient-LVSM achieves 29.86 dB PSNR on RealEstate10K with 2 input views, surpassing LVSM by 0.2 dB, with 2x faster training convergence and 4.4x faster inference speed. Efficient-LVSM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen view counts, and enables incremental inference with KV-cache, thanks to its decoupled designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
