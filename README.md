| **[AnyView: Synthesizing Any Novel View in Dynamic Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16982v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern generative video models excel at producing convincing, high-quality outputs, but struggle to maintain multi-view and spatiotemporal consistency in highly dynamic real-world environments. In this work, we introduce \textbf{AnyView}, a diffusion-based video generation framework for \emph{dynamic view synthesis} with minimal inductive biases or geometric assumptions. We leverage multiple data sources with various levels of supervision, including monocular (2D), multi-view static (3D) and multi-view dynamic (4D) datasets, to train a generalist spatiotemporal implicit representation capable of producing zero-shot novel videos from arbitrary camera locations and trajectories. We evaluate AnyView on standard benchmarks, showing competitive results with the current state of the art, and propose \textbf{AnyViewBench}, a challenging new benchmark tailored towards \emph{extreme} dynamic view synthesis in diverse real-world scenarios. In this more dramatic setting, we find that most baselines drastically degrade in performance, as they require significant overlap between viewpoints, while AnyView maintains the ability to produce realistic, plausible, and spatiotemporally consistent videos when prompted from \emph{any} viewpoint.

| **[SyncLight: Controllable and Consistent Multi-View Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16981v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SyncLight, the first method to enable consistent, parametric relighting across multiple uncalibrated views of a static scene. While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://sync-light.github.io</p></details> |
| **[A Scalable Measure of Loss Landscape Curvature for Analyzing the Training Dynamics of LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16979v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the curvature evolution of the loss landscape is fundamental to analyzing the training dynamics of neural networks. The most commonly studied measure, Hessian sharpness ($λ_{\max}^H$) -- the largest eigenvalue of the loss Hessian -- determines local training stability and interacts with the learning rate throughout training. Despite its significance in analyzing training dynamics, direct measurement of Hessian sharpness remains prohibitive for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to high computational cost. We analyze $\textit{critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c$), a computationally efficient measure requiring fewer than $10$ forward passes given the update direction $Δ\mathbfθ$. Critically, this measure captures well-documented Hessian sharpness phenomena, including progressive sharpening and Edge of Stability. Using this measure, we provide the first demonstration of these sharpness phenomena at scale, up to $7$B parameters, spanning both pre-training and mid-training of OLMo-2 models. We further introduce $\textit{relative critical sharpness}$ ($λ_c^{1\to 2}$), which quantifies the curvature of one loss landscape while optimizing another, to analyze the transition from pre-training to fine-tuning and guide data mixing strategies. Critical sharpness provides practitioners with a practical tool for diagnosing curvature dynamics and informing data composition choices at scale. More broadly, our work shows that scalable curvature measures can provide actionable insights for large-scale training.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[MapAnything: Universal Feed-Forward Metric 3D Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13414v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce MapAnything, a unified transformer-based feed-forward model that ingests one or more images along with optional geometric inputs such as camera intrinsics, poses, depth, or partial reconstructions, and then directly regresses the metric 3D scene geometry and cameras. MapAnything leverages a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.</p></details> | <details><summary>3DV 2...</summary><p>3DV 2026.

| **[Latent Diffusion for Internet of Things Attack Data Generation in Intrusion Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16976v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) are a key component for protecting Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However, in Machine Learning-based (ML-based) IDSs, performance is often degraded by the strong class imbalance between benign and attack traffic. Although data augmentation has been widely explored to mitigate this issue, existing approaches typically rely on simple oversampling techniques or generative models that struggle to simultaneously achieve high sample fidelity, diversity, and computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose the use of a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) for attack data augmentation in IoT intrusion detection and provide a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art baselines. Experiments were conducted on three representative IoT attack types, specifically Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS), Mirai, and Man-in-the-Middle, evaluating both downstream IDS performance and intrinsic generative quality using distributional, dependency-based, and diversity metrics. Results show that balancing the training data with LDM-generated samples substantially improves IDS performance, achieving F1-scores of up to 0.99 for DDoS and Mirai attacks and consistently outperforming competing methods. Additionally, quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate that LDMs effectively preserve feature dependencies while generating diverse samples and reduce sampling time by approximately 25\% compared to diffusion models operating directly in data space. These findings highlight latent diffusion as an effective and scalable solution for synthetic IoT attack data generation, substantially mitigating the impact of class imbalance in ML-based IDSs for IoT scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE. 15 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[LLM Reasoning for Cold-Start Item Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18261v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant potential for improving recommendation systems through their inherent reasoning capabilities and extensive knowledge base. Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2026 (WWW 2026)</p></details> |
| **[VisGym: Diverse, Customizable, Scalable Environments for Multimodal Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16973v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain poorly characterized in multi-step visual interactions, particularly in how they integrate perception, memory, and action over long horizons. We introduce VisGym, a gymnasium of 17 environments for evaluating and training VLMs. The suite spans symbolic puzzles, real-image understanding, navigation, and manipulation, and provides flexible controls over difficulty, input representation, planning horizon, and feedback. We also provide multi-step solvers that generate structured demonstrations, enabling supervised finetuning. Our evaluations show that all frontier models struggle in interactive settings, achieving low success rates in both the easy (46.6%) and hard (26.0%) configurations. Our experiments reveal notable limitations: models struggle to effectively leverage long context, performing worse with an unbounded history than with truncated windows. Furthermore, we find that several text-based symbolic tasks become substantially harder once rendered visually. However, explicit goal observations, textual feedback, and exploratory demonstrations in partially observable or unknown-dynamics settings for supervised finetuning yield consistent gains, highlighting concrete failure modes and pathways for improving multi-step visual decision-making.

| **[Q-learning with Adjoint Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14234v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Q-learning with Adjoint Matching (QAM), a novel TD-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that tackles a long-standing challenge in continuous-action RL: efficient optimization of an expressive diffusion or flow-matching policy with respect to a parameterized Q-function. Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Empowering Medical Equipment Sustainability in Low-Resource Settings: An AI-Powered Diagnostic and Support Platform for Biomedical Technicians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16967v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), a significant proportion of medical diagnostic equipment remains underutilized or non-functional due to a lack of timely maintenance, limited access to technical expertise, and minimal support from manufacturers, particularly for devices acquired through third-party vendors or donations. This challenge contributes to increased equipment downtime, delayed diagnoses, and compromised patient care. This research explores the development and validation of an AI-powered support platform designed to assist biomedical technicians in diagnosing and repairing medical devices in real-time. The system integrates a large language model (LLM) with a user-friendly web interface, enabling imaging technologists/radiographers and biomedical technicians to input error codes or device symptoms and receive accurate, step-by-step troubleshooting guidance. The platform also includes a global peer-to-peer discussion forum to support knowledge exchange and provide additional context for rare or undocumented issues. A proof of concept was developed using the Philips HDI 5000 ultrasound machine, achieving 100% precision in error code interpretation and 80% accuracy in suggesting corrective actions. This study demonstrates the feasibility and potential of AI-driven systems to support medical device maintenance, with the aim of reducing equipment downtime to improve healthcare delivery in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the MIRASOL Workshop at MICCAI 2025.

| **[Ultrafast topological data analysis reveals pandemic-scale dynamics of convergent evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.07292v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genome variants which re-occur independently across evolutionary lineages are key molecular signatures of adaptation. Inferring the dynamics of such genetic changes from pandemic-scale genomic datasets is now possible, which opens up unprecedented insight into evolutionary processes. However, existing approaches depend on the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees, which remains challenging at scale. Here we present EVOtRec, an organism-agnostic, fast and scalable Topological Data Analysis approach that enables the inference of convergently evolving genomic variants over time directly from topological patterns in the dataset, without requiring the construction of a phylogenetic tree. Using data from both simulations and published experiments, we show that EVOtRec can robustly identify variants under positive selection and performs orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art phylogeny-based approaches, with comparable results. We apply EVOtRec to three large viral genome datasets: SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus A subtype H5N1 and HIV-1. We identify key convergent genome variants and demonstrate how EVOtRec facilitates the real-time tracking of high fitness variants in large datasets with millions of genomes, including effects modulated by varying genomic backgrounds. We envision our Topological Data Analysis approach as a new framework for efficient comparative genomics.</p></details> | substantial revision |
| **[AgentDrive: An Open Benchmark Dataset for Agentic AI Reasoning with LLM-Generated Scenarios in Autonomous Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16964v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has sparked growing interest in their integration into autonomous systems for reasoning-driven perception, planning, and decision-making. However, evaluating and training such agentic AI models remains challenging due to the lack of large-scale, structured, and safety-critical benchmarks. This paper introduces AgentDrive, an open benchmark dataset containing 300,000 LLM-generated driving scenarios designed for training, fine-tuning, and evaluating autonomous agents under diverse conditions. AgentDrive formalizes a factorized scenario space across seven orthogonal axes: scenario type, driver behavior, environment, road layout, objective, difficulty, and traffic density. An LLM-driven prompt-to-JSON pipeline generates semantically rich, simulation-ready specifications that are validated against physical and schema constraints. Each scenario undergoes simulation rollouts, surrogate safety metric computation, and rule-based outcome labeling. To complement simulation-based evaluation, we introduce AgentDrive-MCQ, a 100,000-question multiple-choice benchmark spanning five reasoning dimensions: physics, policy, hybrid, scenario, and comparative reasoning. We conduct a large-scale evaluation of fifty leading LLMs on AgentDrive-MCQ. Results show that while proprietary frontier models perform best in contextual and policy reasoning, advanced open models are rapidly closing the gap in structured and physics-grounded reasoning. We release the AgentDrive dataset, AgentDrive-MCQ benchmark, evaluation code, and related materials at https://github.com/maferrag/AgentDrive</p></details> | 16 pages |

Probabilistic graphical models offer powerful tools for uncovering the dependence structures and data-generating processes underlying a wide array of cosmic variables. By representing variables as nodes in a network, these models allow for the visualization and analysis of the intricate relationships that underpin theories of hierarchical structure formation within the universe. We highlight the value that graphical models bring to astronomical research by demonstrating their practical application to the study of exoplanets and host stars.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Evaluating the Effect of Retrieval Augmentation on Social Biases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17611v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has gained popularity as a method for conveniently incorporating novel facts that were not seen during the pre-training stage in Large Language Model (LLM)-based Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. However, LLMs are known to encode significant levels of unfair social biases. The modulation of these biases by RAG in NLG systems is not well understood. In this paper, we systematically study the relationship between the different components of a RAG system and the social biases presented in the text generated across three languages (i.e. English, Japanese and Chinese) and four social bias types (i.e. gender, race, age and religion). Specifically, using the Bias Question Answering (BBQ) benchmark datasets, we evaluate the social biases in RAG responses from document collections with varying levels of stereotypical biases, employing multiple LLMs used as generators. We find that the biases in document collections are often amplified in the generated responses, even when the generating LLM exhibits a low-level of bias. Our findings raise concerns about the use of RAG as a technique for injecting novel facts into NLG systems and call for careful evaluation of potential social biases in RAG applications before their real-world deployment.</p></details> | EACL26 main |
| **[Optimal Oblivious Load-Balancing for Sparse Traffic in Large-Scale Satellite Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02537v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oblivious load-balancing in networks involves routing traffic from sources to destinations using predetermined routes independent of the traffic, so that the maximum load on any link in the network is minimized. We investigate oblivious load-balancing schemes for a $N\times N$ torus network under sparse traffic where there are at most $k$ active source-destination pairs. We are motivated by the problem of load-balancing in large-scale LEO satellite networks, which can be modelled as a torus, where the traffic is known to be sparse and localized to certain hotspot areas. We formulate the problem as a linear program and show that no oblivious routing scheme can achieve a worst-case load lower than approximately $\frac{\sqrt{2k}}{4}$ when $1<k \leq N^2/2$ and $\frac{N}{4}$ when $N^2/2\leq k\leq N^2$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the celebrated Valiant Load Balancing scheme is suboptimal under sparse traffic and construct an optimal oblivious load-balancing scheme that achieves the lower bound. Further, we discover a $\sqrt{2}$ multiplicative gap between the worst-case load of a non-oblivious routing and the worst-case load of any oblivious routing. The results can also be extended to general $N\times M$ tori with unequal link capacities along the vertical and horizontal directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>To Ap...</summary><p>To Appear in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |
| **[Efficient semantic uncertainty quantification in language models via diversity-steered sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21310v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately estimating semantic aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in large language models (LLMs) is particularly challenging in free-form question answering (QA), where obtaining stable estimates often requires many expensive generations. We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (+7 appendix), 7 figures.

| **[A Machine Learning Approach for Detection of Mental Health Conditions and Cyberbullying from Social Media](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20001v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mental health challenges and cyberbullying are increasingly prevalent in digital spaces, necessitating scalable and interpretable detection systems. This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentation at the AAAI-26 Bridge Program on AI for Medicine and Healthcare.

On Calibration and Diversity of Efficient Ensembles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16936v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In resource-constrained and low-latency settings, uncertainty estimates must be efficiently obtained. Deep Ensembles provide robust epistemic uncertainty (EU) but require training multiple full-size models. BatchEnsemble aims to deliver ensemble-like EU at far lower parameter and memory cost by applying learned rank-1 perturbations to a shared base network. We show that BatchEnsemble not only underperforms Deep Ensembles but closely tracks a single model baseline in terms of accuracy, calibration and out-of-distribution (OOD) detection on CIFAR10/10C/SVHN. A controlled study on MNIST finds members are near-identical in function and parameter space, indicating limited capacity to realize distinct predictive modes. Thus, BatchEnsemble behaves more like a single model than a true ensemble.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 1st workshop on Epistemic Intelligence in Machine Learning at EurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[AERO: Adaptive and Efficient Runtime-Aware OTA Updates for Energy-Harvesting IoT](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16935v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy-harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) devices operate under intermittent energy availability, which disrupts task execution and makes energy-intensive over-the-air (OTA) updates particularly challenging. Conventional OTA update mechanisms rely on reboots and incur significant overhead, rendering them unsuitable for intermittently powered systems. Recent live OTA update techniques reduce reboot overhead but still lack mechanisms to ensure consistency when updates interact with runtime execution. This paper presents AERO, an Adaptive and Efficient Runtime-Aware OTA update mechanism that integrates update tasks into the device's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and schedules them alongside routine tasks under energy and timing constraints. By identifying update-affected execution regions and dynamically adjusting dependencies, AERO ensures consistent up date integration while adapting to intermittent energy availability. Experiments on representative workloads demonstrate improved update reliability and efficiency compared to existing live update approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DATE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Reward-Forcing: Autoregressive Video Generation with Reward Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16933v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While most prior work in video generation relies on bidirectional architectures, recent efforts have sought to adapt these models into autoregressive variants to support near real-time generation. However, such adaptations often depend heavily on teacher models, which can limit performance, particularly in the absence of a strong autoregressive teacher, resulting in output quality that typically lags behind their bidirectional counterparts. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach that uses reward signals to guide the generation process, enabling more efficient and scalable autoregressive generation. By using reward signals to guide the model, our method simplifies training while preserving high visual fidelity and temporal consistency. Through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, we find that our approach performs comparably to existing autoregressive models and, in some cases, surpasses similarly sized bidirectional models by avoiding constraints imposed by teacher architectures. For example, on VBench, our method achieves a total score of 84.92, closely matching state-of-the-art autoregressive methods that score 84.31 but require significant heterogeneous distillation.</p></details> | preprint |

The baseline model can compress a 20-second video into a context at about 5k length, where random frames can be retrieved with perceptually preserved appearances. Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss. We evaluate the framework with ablative settings and discuss the trade-offs of possible neural architecture designs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Addit...</summary><p>Additional Results: https://lllyasviel.github.io/pfp_gitpage/</p></details> |
| **[CASE -- Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings for Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity Measurement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17279v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The meaning conveyed by a sentence often depends on the context in which it appears. Despite the progress of sentence embedding methods, it remains unclear how to best modify a sentence embedding conditioned on its context. To address this problem, we propose Condition-Aware Sentence Embeddings (CASE), an efficient and accurate method to create an embedding for a sentence under a given condition. First, CASE creates an embedding for the condition using a Large Language Model (LLM), where the sentence influences the attention scores computed for the tokens in the condition during pooling. Next, a supervised nonlinear projection is learned to reduce the dimensionality of the LLM-based text embeddings. We show that CASE significantly outperforms previously proposed Conditional Semantic Textual Similarity (C-STS) methods on an existing standard benchmark dataset. We find that subtracting the condition embedding consistently improves the C-STS performance of LLM-based text embeddings. Moreover, we propose a supervised dimensionality reduction method that not only reduces the dimensionality of LLM-based embeddings but also significantly improves their performance.</p></details> | Accepted to EACL2026 |
| **[Nishpaksh: TEC Standard-Compliant Framework for Fairness Auditing and Certification of AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16926v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing reliance on Artificial Intelligence (AI) models in high-stakes decision-making systems, particularly within emerging telecom and 6G applications, underscores the urgent need for transparent and standardized fairness assessment frameworks. While global toolkits such as IBM AI Fairness 360 and Microsoft Fairlearn have advanced bias detection, they often lack alignment with region-specific regulatory requirements and national priorities. To address this gap, we propose Nishpaksh, an indigenous fairness evaluation tool that operationalizes the Telecommunication Engineering Centre (TEC) Standard for the Evaluation and Rating of Artificial Intelligence Systems. Nishpaksh integrates survey-based risk quantification, contextual threshold determination, and quantitative fairness evaluation into a unified, web-based dashboard. The tool employs vectorized computation, reactive state management, and certification-ready reporting to enable reproducible, audit-grade assessments, thereby addressing a critical post-standardization implementation need. Experimental validation on the COMPAS dataset demonstrates Nishpaksh's effectiveness in identifying attribute-specific bias and generating standardized fairness scores compliant with the TEC framework. The system bridges the gap between research-oriented fairness methodologies and regulatory AI governance in India, marking a significant step toward responsible and auditable AI deployment within critical infrastructure like telecommunications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at 2026 18th International Conference on COMmunication Systems and NETworks (COMSNETS)</p></details> |
| **[HEIGHT: Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer for Robot Navigation in Crowded and Constrained Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12150v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with static constraints such as corridors and furniture. Previous methods fail to consider all types of spatial and temporal interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different inputs and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success, navigation time, and generalization to domain shifts in challenging navigation scenarios.

| **[LoL: Longer than Longer, Scaling Video Generation to Hour](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16914v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in long-form video generation has shifted from bidirectional to autoregressive models, yet these methods commonly suffer from error accumulation and a loss of long-term coherence. While attention sink frames have been introduced to mitigate this performance decay, they often induce a critical failure mode we term sink-collapse: the generated content repeatedly reverts to the sink frame, resulting in abrupt scene resets and cyclic motion patterns. Our analysis reveals that sink-collapse originates from an inherent conflict between the periodic structure of Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and the multi-head attention mechanisms prevalent in current generative models. To address it, we propose a lightweight, training-free approach that effectively suppresses this behavior by introducing multi-head RoPE jitter that breaks inter-head attention homogenization and mitigates long-horizon collapse. Extensive experiments show that our method successfully alleviates sink-collapse while preserving generation quality. To the best of our knowledge, this work achieves the first demonstration of real-time, streaming, and infinite-length video generation with little quality decay. As an illustration of this robustness, we generate continuous videos up to 12 hours in length, which, to our knowledge, is among the longest publicly demonstrated results in streaming video generation.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[T-LoRA: Single Image Diffusion Model Customization Without Overfitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05964v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion model fine-tuning offers a powerful approach for customizing pre-trained models to generate specific objects, it frequently suffers from overfitting when training samples are limited, compromising both generalization capability and output diversity. This paper tackles the challenging yet most impactful task of adapting a diffusion model using just a single concept image, as single-image customization holds the greatest practical potential. We introduce T-LoRA, a Timestep-Dependent Low-Rank Adaptation framework specifically designed for diffusion model personalization. We show that higher diffusion timesteps are more prone to overfitting than lower ones, necessitating a timestep-sensitive fine-tuning strategy. T-LoRA incorporates two key innovations: (1) a dynamic fine-tuning strategy that adjusts rank-constrained updates based on diffusion timesteps, and (2) a weight parametrization technique that ensures independence between adapter components through orthogonal initialization. Extensive experiments on SD-XL and FLUX-1.dev show that T-LoRA and its individual components outperform standard LoRA and other diffusion model personalization techniques, achieving a superior balance between concept fidelity and text alignment.

We address both issues in a continent-scale, sector-specific evaluation of Chinese and World Bank projects across 9,899 neighborhoods in 36 African countries (2002-2013), representative of ~88% of the population. First, we use a recent dataset that measures living conditions with a machine-learned wealth index derived from contemporaneous satellite imagery, yielding a consistent panel of 6.7 km square mosaics. Second, to strengthen identification, we proxy officials' map-based placement criteria using pre-treatment daytime satellite images and fuse these with tabular covariates to estimate funder- and sector-specific ATEs via inverse-probability weighting. Incorporating imagery often shrinks effects relative to tabular-only models. On average, both donors raise wealth, with larger and more consistent gains for China; sector extremes in our sample include Trade and Tourism (330) for the World Bank (+12.29 IWI points), and Emergency Response (700) for China (+15.15). Assignment-mechanism analyses also show World Bank placement is often more predictable from imagery alone (as well as from tabular covariates). This suggests that Chinese project placements are more driven by non-visible, political, or event-driven factors than World Bank placements. To probe residual concerns about selection on observables, we also estimate within-neighborhood (unit) fixed-effects models at a spatial resolution about 67 times finer than prior fixed-effects analyses, leveraging the computer-vision-imputed IWI panels; these deliver smaller but, for Chinese projects, directionally consistent effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Forth...</summary><p>Forthcoming in World Development</p></details> |

Deterministic machine learning models are unable to capture this multiplicity, averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In this work, we formalize the use of generative AI, specifically flow matching, as a principled way to model the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our approach builds on existing techniques by combining flow matching with equivariant architectures and an optimal-transport-based coupling mechanism. We generalize equivariant flow matching to a symmetric coupling strategy that aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of systems, from simple conceptual systems to physical problems such as buckling beams and the Allen--Cahn equation. The results demonstrate that the approach accurately captures multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations. Moreover, our results demonstrate that flow matching significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods. This offers a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in high-dimensional systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures including appendices.

In this work, we introduce Reliable Subset Reduction (RSR), a reliability-driven preprocessing framework that leverages belief propagation (BP) statistics to identify and remove highly reliable qubits, substantially reducing the effective problem size. Additionally, we identify a degeneracy condition that allows high-order OSD to be simplified to order-0 OSD. By integrating these techniques, we present an ADOSD algorithm that significantly improves OSD efficiency. Our BP+RSR+ADOSD framework extends naturally to circuit-level noise and can handle large-scale codes with more than $10^4$ error variables. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate improved performance over MWPM and Localized Statistics Decoding for a variety of CSS and non-CSS codes under the code-capacity noise model, and for rotated surface codes under realistic circuit-level noise. At low physical error rates, RSR reduces the effective problem size to less than 5\%, enabling higher-order OSD with accelerated runtime. These results highlight the practical efficiency and broad applicability of the BP+ADOSD framework for both theoretical and realistic quantum error correction scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages.

| **[Programming over Thinking: Efficient and Robust Multi-Constraint Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09097v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-constraint planning involves identifying, evaluating, and refining candidate plans while satisfying multiple, potentially conflicting constraints. Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://sync-light.github.io</p></details> |

MapAnything leverages a factored representation of multi-view scene geometry, i.e., a collection of depth maps, local ray maps, camera poses, and a metric scale factor that effectively upgrades local reconstructions into a globally consistent metric frame. Standardizing the supervision and training across diverse datasets, along with flexible input augmentation, enables MapAnything to address a broad range of 3D vision tasks in a single feed-forward pass, including uncalibrated structure-from-motion, calibrated multi-view stereo, monocular depth estimation, camera localization, depth completion, and more. We provide extensive experimental analyses and model ablations demonstrating that MapAnything outperforms or matches specialist feed-forward models while offering more efficient joint training behavior, thus paving the way toward a universal 3D reconstruction backbone.</p></details> | <details><summary>3DV 2...</summary><p>3DV 2026.

| **[Q-learning with Adjoint Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14234v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Q-learning with Adjoint Matching (QAM), a novel TD-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that tackles a long-standing challenge in continuous-action RL: efficient optimization of an expressive diffusion or flow-matching policy with respect to a parameterized Q-function. Effective optimization requires exploiting the first-order information of the critic, but it is challenging to do so for flow or diffusion policies because direct gradient-based optimization via backpropagation through their multi-step denoising process is numerically unstable. Existing methods work around this either by only using the value and discarding the gradient information, or by relying on approximations that sacrifice policy expressivity or bias the learned policy. QAM sidesteps both of these challenges by leveraging adjoint matching, a recently proposed technique in generative modeling, which transforms the critic's action gradient to form a step-wise objective function that is free from unstable backpropagation, while providing an unbiased, expressive policy at the optimum. Combined with temporal-difference backup for critic learning, QAM consistently outperforms prior approaches on hard, sparse reward tasks in both offline and offline-to-online RL.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

However, existing LLM-based agents often fail at genuine geospatial computation, relying instead on web search or pattern matching while hallucinating spatial relationships. We present Spatial-Agent, an AI agent grounded in foundational theories of spatial information science. Our approach formalizes geo-analytical question answering as a concept transformation problem, where natural-language questions are parsed into executable workflows represented as GeoFlow Graphs -- directed acyclic graphs with nodes corresponding to spatial concepts and edges representing transformations. Drawing on spatial information theory, Spatial-Agent extracts spatial concepts, assigns functional roles with principled ordering constraints, and composes transformation sequences through template-based generation. Extensive experiments on MapEval-API and MapQA benchmarks demonstrate that Spatial-Agent significantly outperforms existing baselines including ReAct and Reflexion, while producing interpretable and executable geospatial workflows.</p></details> | 15pages, 4 figures |

This paper introduces a unified multiclass classification framework for detecting ten distinct mental health and cyberbullying categories from social media data. We curate datasets from Twitter and Reddit, implementing a rigorous "split-then-balance" pipeline to train on balanced data while evaluating on a realistic, held-out imbalanced test set. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation comparing traditional lexical models, hybrid approaches, and several end-to-end fine-tuned transformers. Our results demonstrate that end-to-end fine-tuning is critical for performance, with the domain-adapted MentalBERT emerging as the top model, achieving an accuracy of 0.92 and a Macro F1 score of 0.76, surpassing both its generic counterpart and a zero-shot LLM baseline. Grounded in a comprehensive ethical analysis, we frame the system as a human-in-the-loop screening aid, not a diagnostic tool. To support this, we introduce a hybrid SHAPLLM explainability framework and present a prototype dashboard ("Social Media Screener") designed to integrate model predictions and their explanations into a practical workflow for moderators. Our work provides a robust baseline, highlighting future needs for multi-label, clinically-validated datasets at the critical intersection of online safety and computational mental health.</p></details> | <details><summary>Oral ...</summary><p>Oral Presentation at the AAAI-26 Bridge Program on AI for Medicine and Healthcare.

Such pretrained models can be directly fine-tuned as memory encoders for autoregressive video models, enabling long history memory with low context cost and relatively low fidelity loss.

| **[In Quest of an Extensible Multi-Level Harm Taxonomy for Adversarial AI: Heart of Security, Ethical Risk Scoring and Resilience Analytics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16930v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Harm is invoked everywhere from cybersecurity, ethics, risk analysis, to adversarial AI, yet there exists no systematic or agreed upon list of harms, and the concept itself is rarely defined with the precision required for serious analysis. Current discourse relies on vague, under specified notions of harm, rendering nuanced, structured, and qualitative assessment effectively impossible. This paper challenges that gap directly. We introduce a structured and expandable taxonomy of harms, grounded in an ensemble of contemporary ethical theories, that makes harm explicit, enumerable, and analytically tractable. The proposed framework identifies 66+ distinct harm types, systematically organized into two overarching domains human and nonhuman, and eleven major categories, each explicitly aligned with eleven dominant ethical theories. While extensible by design, the upper levels are intentionally stable. Beyond classification, we introduce a theory-aware taxonomy of victim entities and formalize normative harm attributes, including reversibility and duration that materially alter ethical severity. Together, these contributions transform harm from a rhetorical placeholder into an operational object of analysis, enabling rigorous ethical reasoning and long term safety evaluation of AI systems and other sociotechnical domains where harm is a first order concern.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript accepted for presentation at the 12th International Conference on Computational Science and Computational Intelligence (CSCI 2025), Las Vegas, NV, USA, December 2025.

| **[HEIGHT: Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer for Robot Navigation in Crowded and Constrained Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12150v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with static constraints such as corridors and furniture. Previous methods fail to consider all types of spatial and temporal interactions among agents and obstacles, leading to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement learning. We first split the representations of different inputs and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph to model distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the heterogeneous spatio-temporal graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of success, navigation time, and generalization to domain shifts in challenging navigation scenarios.

| **[Calibrated Similarity for Reliable Geometric Analysis of Embedding Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16907v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While raw cosine similarity in pretrained embedding spaces exhibits strong rank correlation with human judgments, anisotropy induces systematic miscalibration of absolute values: scores concentrate in a narrow high-similarity band regardless of actual semantic relatedness, limiting interpretability as a quantitative measure. Prior work addresses this by modifying the embedding space (whitening, contrastive fine tuning), but such transformations alter geometric structure and require recomputing all embeddings. Using isotonic regression trained on human similarity judgments, we construct a monotonic transformation that achieves near-perfect calibration while preserving rank correlation and local stability(98% across seven perturbation types). Our contribution is not to replace cosine similarity, but to restore interpretability of its absolute values through monotone calibration, without altering its ranking properties. We characterize isotonic calibration as an order-preserving reparameterization and prove that all order-based constructions (angular ordering, nearest neighbors, threshold graphs and quantile-based decisions) are invariant under this transformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2512.10350</p></details> |
| **[Provably Learning Attention with Queries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16873v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning Transformer-based sequence models with black-box access to their outputs. In this setting, a learner may adaptively query the oracle with any sequence of vectors and observe the corresponding real-valued output. We begin with the simplest case, a single-head softmax-attention regressor. We show that for a model with width $d$, there is an elementary algorithm to learn the parameters of single-head attention exactly with $O(d^2)$ queries. Further, we show that if there exists an algorithm to learn ReLU feedforward networks (FFNs), then the single-head algorithm can be easily adapted to learn one-layer Transformers with single-head attention. Next, motivated by the regime where the head dimension $r \ll d$, we provide a randomised algorithm that learns single-head attention-based models with $O(rd)$ queries via compressed sensing arguments. We also study robustness to noisy oracle access, proving that under mild norm and margin conditions, the parameters can be estimated to $\varepsilon$ accuracy with a polynomial number of queries even when outputs are only provided up to additive tolerance. Finally, we show that multi-head attention parameters are not identifiable from value queries in general -- distinct parameterisations can induce the same input-output map. Hence, guarantees analogous to the single-head setting are impossible without additional structural assumptions.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[The Curse of Depth in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05795v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Curse of Depth, a concept that highlights, explains, and addresses the recent observation in modern Large Language Models (LLMs) where nearly half of the layers are less effective than expected. We first confirm the wide existence of this phenomenon across the most popular families of LLMs such as Llama, Mistral, DeepSeek, and Qwen. Our analysis, theoretically and empirically, identifies that the underlying reason for the ineffectiveness of deep layers in LLMs is the widespread usage of Pre-Layer Normalization (Pre-LN). While Pre-LN stabilizes the training of Transformer LLMs, its output variance exponentially grows with the model depth, which undesirably causes the derivative of the deep Transformer blocks to be an identity matrix, and therefore barely contributes to the training. To resolve this training pitfall, we propose LayerNorm Scaling (LNS), which scales the variance of output of the layer normalization inversely by the square root of its depth. This simple modification mitigates the output variance explosion of deeper Transformer layers, improving their contribution. Across a wide range of model sizes (130M to 7B), our experiments show that LNS consistently outperforms previous normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing LLM pre-training performance. Moreover, this improvement seamlessly carries over to supervised fine-tuning. All these gains can be attributed to the fact that LayerNorm Scaling enables deeper layers to contribute more effectively during training. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/lmsdss/LayerNorm-Scaling}{LayerNorm-Scaling}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

This paper presents a robust, fully automated framework that transforms unstructured B-rep geometry into knowledge-graph-based Building Information Models and further into executable Building Energy Models. The framework enables artificial intelligence to explicitly interpret building elements, spatial topology, and their associated thermal and performance attributes. It integrates automated geometry cleansing, multiple auto space-generation strategies, graph-based extraction of space and element topology, ontology-aligned knowledge modeling, and reversible transformation between ontology-based BIM and EnergyPlus energy models. Validation on parametric, sketch-based, and real-world building datasets demonstrates high robustness, consistent topological reconstruction, and reliable performance-model generation. By bridging design models, BIM, and BEM, the framework provides an AI-oriented infrastructure that extends BIM- and graph-based intelligence pipelines to flexible early-stage design geometry, enabling performance-driven design exploration and optimization by learning-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Advanced Engineering Informatics, currently Under Review</p></details> |

We present Prometheus Mind, which retrofits memory to a frozen Qwen3-4B using 11 modular adapters (530MB, 7% overhead) -- fully reversible by removing the adapters. Building this system required solving four problems: (1) Extraction -- we develop Contrastive Direction Discovery (CDD), which finds semantic directions via minimal pairs without labeled data. (2) Training -- end-to-end optimization collapses; stage-wise training of each adapter on simple proxy tasks succeeds. (3) Injection -- learned encoders fail to generalize; we find that lm_head-weight rows already provide the mapping we need, requiring no training. (4) Hidden state collapse -- transformers make ``wife'' and ``brother'' 0.98+ similar; we train projections to recover distinction (0.98 $\rightarrow$ 0.09). On PrometheusExtract-132 (132 cases), the system achieves 94.4% retrieval on clean inputs (n=54, 95% CI: [84.9%, 98.1%]), degrading to 19.4% on informal inputs with ellipsis, filler words, or implicit subjects (n=36).

While various context compression approaches such as LongLLMLingua have emerged to tackle this challenge, they typically rely on fixed metrics such as PPL, ignoring the task-specific nature of code understanding. As a result, they frequently disrupt syntactic and logical structure and fail to retain critical implementation details. In this paper, we propose SWE-Pruner, a self-adaptive context pruning framework tailored for coding agents. Drawing inspiration from how human programmers "selectively skim" source code during development and debugging, SWE-Pruner performs task-aware adaptive pruning for long contexts. Given the current task, the agent formulates an explicit goal (e.g., "focus on error handling") as a hint to guide the pruning targets. A lightweight neural skimmer (0.6B parameters) is trained to dynamically select relevant lines from the surrounding context given the goal. Evaluations across four benchmarks and multiple models validate SWE-Pruner's effectiveness in various scenarios, achieving 23-54% token reduction on agent tasks like SWE-Bench Verified and up to 14.84x compression on single-turn tasks like LongCodeQA with minimal performance impact.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/Ayanami1314/swe-pruner</p></details> |

To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Adaptive Fourier Network (GAF-Net), a lightweight deep complex network that aims to establish a balance between performance and computational efficiency. The GAF-Net architecture consists of three components. First, a dual-feature encoder combining short-time Fourier transform and gammatone features enhances the robustness of acoustic representation. Second, a channel-independent globally adaptive Fourier modulator efficiently captures long-term temporal dependencies while preserving the spatial cues. Finally, a dynamic gating mechanism is implemented to reduce processing artifacts. Experimental results show that GAF-Net achieves competitive performance, particularly in terms of binaural cues (ILD and IPD error) and objective intelligibility (MBSTOI), with fewer parameters and computational cost. These results confirm that GAF-Net provides a feasible way to achieve high-fidelity binaural processing on resource-constrained devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Masked Modeling for Human Motion Recovery Under Occlusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16079v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation, but remains challenging under frequent occlusions in real-world settings. Existing regression-based methods are efficient but fragile to missing observations, while optimization- and diffusion-based approaches improve robustness at the cost of slow inference speed and heavy preprocessing steps. To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mikeqzy.github.io/MoRo</p></details> |
| **[From Transactions to Exploits: Automated PoC Synthesis for Real-World DeFi Attacks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16681v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Blockchain systems are increasingly targeted by on-chain attacks that exploit contract vulnerabilities to extract value rapidly and stealthily, making systematic analysis and reproduction highly challenging. In practice, reproducing such attacks requires manually crafting proofs-of-concept (PoCs), a labor-intensive process that demands substantial expertise and scales poorly. In this work, we present the first automated framework for synthesizing verifiable PoCs directly from on-chain attack executions. Our key insight is that attacker logic can be recovered from low-level transaction traces via trace-driven reverse engineering, and then translated into executable exploits by leveraging the code-generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). To this end, we propose TracExp, which localizes attack-relevant execution contexts from noisy, multi-contract traces and introduces a novel dual-decompiler to transform concrete executions into semantically enriched exploit pseudocode. Guided by this representation, TracExp synthesizes PoCs and refines them to preserve exploitability-relevant semantics. We evaluate TracExp on 321 real-world attacks over the past 20 months.

A central practical challenge is resolving the trade-off between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism. To address inference efficiency, many recent works have explored knowledge distillation strategies specifically tailored to SR, enabling one-step diffusion-based approaches. However, these teacher-student formulations are inherently constrained by information compression, which can degrade perceptual cues such as lifelike textures and depth of field, even with high overall perceptual quality. In parallel, self-distillation DMs, known as Flow Map models, have emerged as a promising alternative for image generation tasks, enabling fast inference while preserving the expressivity and training stability of standard DMs. Building on these developments, we propose FlowMapSR, a novel diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution explicitly designed for efficient inference. Beyond adapting Flow Map models to SR, we introduce two complementary enhancements: (i) positive-negative prompting guidance, based on a generalization of classifier free-guidance paradigm to Flow Map models, and (ii) adversarial fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Among the considered Flow Map formulations (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Shortcut), we find that the Shortcut variant consistently achieves the best performance when combined with these enhancements. Extensive experiments show that FlowMapSR achieves a better balance between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism than recent state-of-the-art methods for both x4 and x8 upscaling, while maintaining competitive inference time. Notably, a single model is used for both upscaling factors, without any scale-specific conditioning or degradation-guided mechanisms.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[PanopMamba: Vision State Space Modeling for Nuclei Panoptic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16631v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nuclei panoptic segmentation supports cancer diagnostics by integrating both semantic and instance segmentation of different cell types to analyze overall tissue structure and individual nuclei in histopathology images. Major challenges include detecting small objects, handling ambiguous boundaries, and addressing class imbalance. To address these issues, we propose PanopMamba, a novel hybrid encoder-decoder architecture that integrates Mamba and Transformer with additional feature-enhanced fusion via state space modeling. We design a multiscale Mamba backbone and a State Space Model (SSM)-based fusion network to enable efficient long-range perception in pyramid features, thereby extending the pure encoder-decoder framework while facilitating information sharing across multiscale features of nuclei. The proposed SSM-based feature-enhanced fusion integrates pyramid feature networks and dynamic feature enhancement across different spatial scales, enhancing the feature representation of densely overlapping nuclei in both semantic and spatial dimensions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Mamba-based approach for panoptic segmentation. Additionally, we introduce alternative evaluation metrics, including image-level Panoptic Quality ($i$PQ), boundary-weighted PQ ($w$PQ), and frequency-weighted PQ ($fw$PQ), which are specifically designed to address the unique challenges of nuclei segmentation and thereby mitigate the potential bias inherent in vanilla PQ. Experimental evaluations on two multiclass nuclei segmentation benchmark datasets, MoNuSAC2020 and NuInsSeg, demonstrate the superiority of PanopMamba for nuclei panoptic segmentation over state-of-the-art methods. Consequently, the robustness of PanopMamba is validated across various metrics, while the distinctiveness of PQ variants is also demonstrated.

Current echocardiography-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) models focus primarily on binary HFpEF detection in humans and do not provide comorbidity-specific phenotyping or temporal estimates of disease progression towards decompensation. We aimed to develop a unified AI framework, CardioMOD-Net, to perform multiclass diagnosis and continuous prediction of HFpEF onset directly from standard echocardiography cine loops in preclinical models. Methods: Mouse echocardiography videos from four groups were used: control (CTL), hyperglycaemic (HG), obesity (OB), and systemic arterial hypertension (SAH). Two-dimensional parasternal long-axis cine loops were decomposed using Higher Order Dynamic Mode Decomposition (HODMD) to extract temporal features for downstream analysis. A shared latent representation supported Vision Transformers, one for a classifier for diagnosis and another for a regression module for predicting the age at HFpEF onset. Results: Overall diagnostic accuracy across the four groups was 65%, with all classes exceeding 50% accuracy. Misclassifications primarily reflected early-stage overlap between OB or SAH and CTL. The prognostic module achieved a root-mean-square error of 21.72 weeks for time-to-HFpEF prediction, with OB and SAH showing the most accurate estimates. Predicted HFpEF onset closely matched true distributions in all groups. Discussion: This unified framework demonstrates that multiclass phenotyping and continuous HFpEF onset prediction can be obtained from a single cine loop, even under small-data conditions. The approach offers a foundation for integrating diagnostic and prognostic modelling in preclinical HFpEF research.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages; 1 figure; letter</p></details> |

The main basic contribution is in defining a notion of a Kraft matrix and in establishing the fact that a necessary condition for information losslessness of a finite-state encoder is that none of the eigenvalues of this matrix have modulus larger than unity, or equivalently, the generalized Kraft inequality asserts that the spectral radius of the Kraft matrix cannot exceed one. For the important special case where the FS encoder is irreducible, we derive several equivalent forms of this inequality, which are based on well known formulas for spectral radius. It also turns out that in the irreducible case, Kraft sums are bounded by a constant, independent of the block length, and thus cannot grow even in any subexponential rate. Finally, two extensions are outlined - one concerns the case of side information available to both encoder and decoder, and the other is for lossy compression.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 figures, to be submitted for publication</p></details> |

However, their potential is currently bottlenecked by the constraints of static data scaling. Existing paradigms relying primarily on passive imitation of static datasets struggle to capture the intricate causal dynamics inherent in long-horizon computer tasks. In this work, we introduce EvoCUA, a native computer use agentic model. Unlike static imitation, EvoCUA integrates data generation and policy optimization into a self-sustaining evolutionary cycle. To mitigate data scarcity, we develop a verifiable synthesis engine that autonomously generates diverse tasks coupled with executable validators. To enable large-scale experience acquisition, we design a scalable infrastructure orchestrating tens of thousands of asynchronous sandbox rollouts. Building on these massive trajectories, we propose an iterative evolving learning strategy to efficiently internalize this experience. This mechanism dynamically regulates policy updates by identifying capability boundaries -- reinforcing successful routines while transforming failure trajectories into rich supervision through error analysis and self-correction. Empirical evaluations on the OSWorld benchmark demonstrate that EvoCUA achieves a success rate of 56.7%, establishing a new open-source state-of-the-art. Notably, EvoCUA significantly outperforms the previous best open-source model, OpenCUA-72B (45.0%), and surpasses leading closed-weights models such as UI-TARS-2 (53.1%). Crucially, our results underscore the generalizability of this approach: the evolving paradigm driven by learning from experience yields consistent performance gains across foundation models of varying scales, establishing a robust and scalable path for advancing native agent capabilities.</p></details> | 26 pages, 8 figures |

This work offers a rigorous, unified benchmark by using four publicly available datasets covering text and image modalities (binary and multiclass complexity) that contrasts traditional Machine Learning (ML) with contemporary transformer-based techniques. We evaluated three model classes for each task: Classical ML (LR, LightGBM, ResNet-50), Prompt-Based LLMs/VLMs (Gemini 2.5), and Fine-Tuned PEFT Models (LoRA-adapted Gemma3 variants). All experiments used consistent data splits and aligned metrics. According to our results, traditional machine learning (ML) models set a high standard by consistently achieving the best overall performance across most medical categorization tasks. This was especially true for structured text-based datasets, where the classical models performed exceptionally well. In stark contrast, the LoRA-tuned Gemma variants consistently showed the worst performance across all text and image experiments, failing to generalize from the minimal fine-tuning provided. However, the zero-shot LLM/VLM pipelines (Gemini 2.5) had mixed results; they performed poorly on text-based tasks, but demonstrated competitive performance on the multiclass image task, matching the classical ResNet-50 baseline. These results demonstrate that in many medical categorization scenarios, established machine learning models continue to be the most reliable option. The experiment suggests that foundation models are not universally superior and that the effectiveness of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) is highly dependent on the adaptation strategy, as minimal fine-tuning proved detrimental in this study.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables, paper accepted in AAIML'26 conference</p></details> |
| **[Soft Graph Transformer for MIMO Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12694v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a soft-input-soft-output neural architecture designed for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML) detection achieves optimal accuracy, its exponential complexity makes it infeasible in large systems, and conventional message-passing algorithms rely on asymptotic assumptions that often fail in finite dimensions. Recent Transformer-based detectors show strong performance but typically overlook the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot exploit prior soft information. SGT addresses these limitations by combining self-attention, which encodes contextual dependencies within symbol and constraint subgraphs, with graph-aware cross-attention, which performs structured message passing across subgraphs. Its soft-input interface allows the integration of auxiliary priors, producing effective soft outputs while maintaining computational efficiency. Experiments demonstrate that SGT achieves near-ML performance and offers a flexible and interpretable framework for receiver systems that leverage soft priors.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages with 3 figures and 2 tables, submitted to IEEE for a possible publication</p></details> |

While recent advancements in applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to time series modeling (TSM) have shown great promise, their effectiveness on the irregular ICU data, characterized by particularly high rates of missing values, remains largely unexplored. This work investigates two key components underlying the success of LLMs for TSM: the time series encoder and the multimodal alignment strategy. To this end, we establish a systematic testbed to evaluate their impact across various state-of-the-art LLM-based methods on benchmark ICU datasets against strong supervised and self-supervised baselines. Results reveal that the encoder design is more critical than the alignment strategy. Encoders that explicitly model irregularity achieve substantial performance gains, yielding an average AUPRC increase of $12.8\%$ over the vanilla Transformer. While less impactful, the alignment strategy is also noteworthy, with the best-performing semantically rich, fusion-based strategy achieving a modest $2.9\%$ improvement over cross-attention. However, LLM-based methods require at least 10$\times$ longer training than the best-performing irregular supervised models, while delivering only comparable performance. They also underperform in data-scarce few-shot learning settings. These findings highlight both the promise and current limitations of LLMs for irregular ICU time series.

In this work, we analyze a shallow Transformer with $m$ independent heads trained by projected gradient descent in the kernel regime. Our analysis reveals two main findings: (i) the width required for nonasymptotic guarantees scales only logarithmically with the sample size $n$, and (ii) the optimization error is independent of the sequence length $T$. This contrasts sharply with recurrent architectures, where the optimization error can grow exponentially with $T$. The trade-off is memory: to keep the full context, the Transformer's memory requirement grows with the sequence length. We validate our theoretical results numerically in a teacher-student setting and confirm the predicted scaling laws for Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AISTATS 2026</p></details> |

While single-view relighting has advanced significantly, existing generative approaches struggle to maintain the rigorous lighting consistency essential for multi-camera broadcasts, stereoscopic cinema, and virtual production. SyncLight addresses this by enabling precise control over light intensity and color across a multi-view capture of a scene, conditioned on a single reference edit. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion transformer trained using a latent bridge matching formulation, achieving high-fidelity relighting of the entire image set in a single inference step. To facilitate training, we introduce a large-scale hybrid dataset comprising diverse synthetic environments -- curated from existing sources and newly designed scenes -- alongside high-fidelity, real-world multi-view captures under calibrated illumination. Surprisingly, though trained only on image pairs, SyncLight generalizes zero-shot to an arbitrary number of viewpoints, effectively propagating lighting changes across all views, without requiring camera pose information. SyncLight enables practical relighting workflows for multi-view capture systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: http://sync-light.github.io</p></details> |

Yet, existing studies predominantly address warm-start scenarios with abundant user-item interaction data, leaving the more challenging cold-start scenarios, where sparse interactions hinder traditional collaborative filtering methods, underexplored. To address this limitation, we propose novel reasoning strategies designed for cold-start item recommendations within the Netflix domain. Our method utilizes the advanced reasoning capabilities of LLMs to effectively infer user preferences, particularly for newly introduced or rarely interacted items. We systematically evaluate supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning-based fine-tuning, and hybrid approaches that combine both methods to optimize recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on real-world data demonstrate significant improvements in both methodological efficacy and practical performance in cold-start recommendation contexts. Remarkably, our reasoning-based fine-tuned models outperform Netflix's production ranking model by up to 8% in certain cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2026 (WWW 2026)</p></details> |

Inferring the dynamics of such genetic changes from pandemic-scale genomic datasets is now possible, which opens up unprecedented insight into evolutionary processes. However, existing approaches depend on the construction of accurate phylogenetic trees, which remains challenging at scale. Here we present EVOtRec, an organism-agnostic, fast and scalable Topological Data Analysis approach that enables the inference of convergently evolving genomic variants over time directly from topological patterns in the dataset, without requiring the construction of a phylogenetic tree. Using data from both simulations and published experiments, we show that EVOtRec can robustly identify variants under positive selection and performs orders of magnitude faster than state-of-the-art phylogeny-based approaches, with comparable results. We apply EVOtRec to three large viral genome datasets: SARS-CoV-2, influenza virus A subtype H5N1 and HIV-1. We identify key convergent genome variants and demonstrate how EVOtRec facilitates the real-time tracking of high fitness variants in large datasets with millions of genomes, including effects modulated by varying genomic backgrounds. We envision our Topological Data Analysis approach as a new framework for efficient comparative genomics.</p></details> | substantial revision |

We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages (+7 appendix), 7 figures.

Existing large language model (LLM) approaches face fundamental limitations in this domain. Pure reasoning paradigms, which rely on long natural language chains, are prone to inconsistency, error accumulation, and prohibitive cost as constraints compound. Conversely, LLMs combined with coding- or solver-based strategies lack flexibility: they often generate problem-specific code from scratch or depend on fixed solvers, failing to capture generalizable logic across diverse problems. To address these challenges, we introduce the Scalable COde Planning Engine (SCOPE), a framework that disentangles query-specific reasoning from generic code execution. By separating reasoning from execution, SCOPE produces solver functions that are consistent, deterministic, and reusable across queries while requiring only minimal changes to input parameters. SCOPE achieves state-of-the-art performance while lowering cost and latency. For example, with GPT-4o, it reaches 93.1% success on TravelPlanner, a 61.6% gain over the best baseline (CoT) while cutting inference cost by 1.4x and time by ~4.67x.

Motivated by the statistical physics origins, Chen, Kastoryano, and Gilyén [CKG23] proposed a continuous-time quantum thermodynamic analogue to Glauber dynamics that is (i) exactly detailed balanced, (ii) efficiently implementable, and (iii) quasi-local for geometrically local systems. Physically, their construction resembles the dissipative dynamics arising from weak system-bath interaction. In this work, we give an efficiently implementable discrete-time counterpart to any continuous-time quantum Gibbs sampler. Our construction preserves the desirable features (i)-(iii) while does not decrease the spectral gap. Also, we give an alternative highly coherent quantum generalization of detailed balanced dynamics that resembles another physically derived master equation, and propose a smooth interpolation between this and earlier constructions. Moreover, we show how to make earlier Metropolis-style Gibbs samplers (which estimate energies both before and after jumps) exactly detailed balanced. We study generic properties of all constructions, including the uniqueness of the fixed point, the (quasi-)locality of the resulting operators. Finally, we prove that the spectral gap of our new highly coherent Gibbs sampler is constant at high temperatures, thereby it mixes fast. We hope that our systematic approach to quantum Glauber and Metropolis dynamics will lead to widespread applications in various domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>74 pa...</summary><p>74 pages, v2: added a new recursive discrete construction and an exact detailed balanced Metropolis style variant while proved high-temperature spectral gap of the new construction</p></details> |

While symmetry handling is routine in other solving paradigms, integrating it into state-of-the-art proof-producing SAT solvers is difficult: added reasoning must be fast, non-interfering with solver heuristics, and compatible with formal proof logging. To address these issues, we present a practical static symmetry breaking approach based on orbitopal fixing, a technique adapted from mixed-integer programming. Our approach adds only unit clauses, which minimizes downstream slowdowns, and it emits succinct proof certificates in the substitution redundancy proof system. Implemented in the satsuma tool, our methods deliver consistent speedups on symmetry-rich benchmarks with negligible regressions elsewhere.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear at TACAS 2026</p></details> |

Traditional methods, such as item-to-item collaborative filtering (CF) and two-tower models, often fall short in capturing the complex user-item interactions due to uniform truncation strategies and overdue user-item crossing. To address these limitations, we propose Personalized Item-to-Item (PI2I), a novel two-stage retrieval framework that enhances the personalization capabilities of CF. In the first Indexer Building Stage (IBS), we optimize the retrieval pool by relaxing truncation thresholds to maximize Hit Rate, thereby temporarily retaining more items users might be interested in. In the second Personalized Retrieval Stage (PRS), we introduce an interactive scoring model to overcome the limitations of inner product calculations, allowing for richer modeling of intricate user-item interactions. Additionally, we construct negative samples based on the trigger-target (item-to-item) relationship, ensuring consistency between offline training and online inference. Offline experiments on large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that PI2I outperforms traditional CF methods and rivals Two-Tower models. Deployed in the "Guess You Like" section on Taobao, PI2I achieved a 1.05% increase in online transaction rates. In addition, we have released a large-scale recommendation dataset collected from Taobao, containing 130 million real-world user interactions used in the experiments of this paper. The dataset is publicly available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/PI2I/PI2I, which could serve as a valuable benchmark for the research community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on WWW'26: In Proceedings of the ACM Web Conference 2026</p></details> |

We present a probabilistic, risk-based access control architecture that couples machine learning inference with mandatory access control to regulate encryption on Linux in real time. The system builds a specialized dataset from the native ftrace framework using the function_graph tracer, yielding high-resolution kernel-function execution traces augmented with resource and I/O counters. These traces support both a supervised classifier and interpretable rules that drive an SELinux policy via lightweight booleans, enabling context-sensitive permit/deny decisions at the moment encryption begins. Compared to approaches centered on sandboxing, hypervisor introspection, or coarse system-call telemetry, the function-level tracing we adopt provides finer behavioral granularity than syscall-only telemetry while avoiding the virtualization/VMI overhead of sandbox-based approaches. Our current user-space prototype has a non-trivial footprint under burst I/O; we quantify it and recognize that a production kernel-space solution should aim to address this. We detail dataset construction, model training and rule extraction, and the run-time integration that gates file writes for suspect encryption while preserving benign cryptographic workflows. During evaluation, the two-layer composition retains model-level detection quality while delivering rule-like responsiveness; we also quantify operational footprint and outline engineering steps to reduce CPU and memory overhead for enterprise deployment. The result is a practical path from behavioral tracing and learning to enforceable, explainable, and risk-proportionate encryption control on production Linux systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Third, we optimize the attention mechanism with a loss function applied on attention weights to achieve precise time alignment between the reference and microphone signals.

A main reason is that the amount of relevant news changes over time and across categories. As a result, some weekly averages are based on many articles, while others rely on only a few. Existing approaches do not explicitly account for changes in data availability when measuring uncertainty. We present a Bayesian state-space framework that turns aggregated news sentiment into a smoothed time series with uncertainty. The model treats each weekly sentiment value as a noisy measurement of an underlying sentiment process, with observation uncertainty scaled by the effective information weight $n_{tj}$: when coverage is high, latent sentiment is anchored more strongly to the observed aggregate; when coverage is low, inference relies more on the latent dynamics and uncertainty increases. Using news data grouped into multiple categories, we find broadly similar latent dynamics across categories, while larger differences appear in observation noise. The framework is designed for descriptive monitoring and can be extended to other text sources where information availability varies over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

We uncover an exceptional regime of agent dynamics that has been overlooked previously. It appears robustly optimal for performance under many conditions, thus providing valuable insights into computation with physical systems more generally. The key to forming effective mechanisms for information processing appears in the system's intrinsic relaxation abilities. These are probed without actually enforcing a specific inference goal. The dynamical regime that achieves optimal computation is located just below a critical damping threshold, involving a relaxation with multiple stages, and is readable at the single-particle level. At the many-body level, it yields substrates robustly optimal for RC across varying physical parameters and inference tasks. A system in this regime exhibits a strong diversity of dynamic mechanisms under highly fluctuating driving forces. Correlations of agent dynamics can express a tight relationship between the responding system and the fluctuating forces driving it. As this model is interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body physics out of equilibrium.</p></details> | <details><summary>81 pa...</summary><p>81 pages, 50 figures.

| **[Supporting Stakeholder Requirements Expression with LLM Revisions: An Empirical Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16699v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stakeholders often struggle to accurately express their requirements due to articulation barriers arising from limited domain knowledge or from cognitive constraints. This can cause misalignment between expressed and intended requirements, complicating elicitation and validation. Traditional elicitation techniques, such as interviews and follow-up sessions, are time-consuming and risk distorting stakeholders' original intent across iterations. Large Language Models (LLMs) can infer user intentions from context, suggesting potential for assisting stakeholders in expressing their needs. This raises the questions of (i) how effectively LLMs can support requirement expression and (ii) whether such support benefits stakeholders with limited domain expertise. We conducted a study with 26 participants who produced 130 requirement statements. Each participant first expressed requirements unaided, then evaluated LLM-generated revisions tailored to their context. Participants rated LLM revisions significantly higher than their original statements across all dimensions-alignment with intent, readability, reasoning, and unambiguity. Qualitative feedback further showed that LLM revisions often surfaced tacit details stakeholders considered important and helped them better understand their own requirements. We present and evaluate a stakeholder-centered approach that leverages LLMs as articulation aids in requirements elicitation and validation. Our results show that LLM-assisted reformulation improves perceived completeness, clarity, and alignment of requirements. By keeping stakeholders in the validation loop, this approach promotes responsible and trustworthy use of AI in Requirements Engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the research track of the 32nd International Working Conference on Requirements Engineering: Foundation for Software Quality (REFSQ 2026)</p></details> |

Existing dataset ownership verification (DOV) methods typically assume that watermarks remain stable during inference; however, this assumption often fails under natural noise and adversary-crafted perturbations. We propose the first certified dataset ownership verification method for PLMs under a gray-box setting (i.e., the defender can only query the suspicious model but is aware of its input representation module), based on dual-space smoothing (i.e., DSSmoothing). To address the challenges of text discreteness and semantic sensitivity, DSSmoothing introduces continuous perturbations in the embedding space to capture semantic robustness and applies controlled token reordering in the permutation space to capture sequential robustness. DSSmoothing consists of two stages: in the first stage, triggers are collaboratively embedded in both spaces to generate norm-constrained and robust watermarked datasets; in the second stage, randomized smoothing is applied in both spaces during verification to compute the watermark robustness (WR) of suspicious models and statistically compare it with the principal probability (PP) values of a set of benign models. Theoretically, DSSmoothing provides provable robustness guarantees for dataset ownership verification by ensuring that WR consistently exceeds PP under bounded dual-space perturbations. Extensive experiments on multiple representative web datasets demonstrate that DSSmoothing achieves stable and reliable verification performance and exhibits robustness against potential adaptive attacks. Our code is available at https://github.com/NcepuQiaoTing/DSSmoothing.</p></details> | 12 pages, 21 figures |

Jailbreak detection methods show promise in mitigating jailbreak attacks through the assistance of other models or multiple model inferences. However, existing methods entail significant computational costs. In this paper, we first present a finding that the difference in output distributions between jailbreak and benign prompts can be employed for detecting jailbreak prompts. Based on this finding, we propose a Free Jailbreak Detection (FJD) which prepends an affirmative instruction to the input and scales the logits by temperature to further distinguish between jailbreak and benign prompts through the confidence of the first token. Furthermore, we enhance the detection performance of FJD through the integration of virtual instruction learning. Extensive experiments on aligned LLMs show that our FJD can effectively detect jailbreak prompts with almost no additional computational costs during LLM inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP 2025 (Findings) https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-emnlp.309/</p></details> |

Availability of parallel resources can significantly speed up MCMC inference by running a large number of chains in parallel, each collecting a single sample. However, the parallel approach converges slowly if the chains are not initialized close to the target distribution (cold start). Theoretically this can be resolved by initially running MCMC without Metropolis-Hastings adjustment to quickly converge to the vicinity of the target distribution and then turn on adjustment to achieve fine convergence. However, no practical scheme uses this strategy, due to the difficulty of automatically selecting the step size during the unadjusted phase. We here develop Late Adjusted Parallel Sampler (LAPS), which is precisely such a scheme and is applicable out of the box, all the hyperparameters are selected automatically. LAPS takes advantage of ensemble-based hyperparameter adaptation to estimate the bias at each iteration and converts it to the appropriate step size. We show that LAPS consistently and significantly outperforms ensemble adjusted methods such as MEADS or ChESS and the optimization-based initializer Pathfinder on a variety of standard benchmark problems. LAPS typically achieves two orders of magnitude lower wall-clock time than the corresponding sequential algorithms such as NUTS.</p></details> | 21 pages, 9 Figures |
| **[Masked Modeling for Human Motion Recovery Under Occlusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16079v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human motion reconstruction from monocular videos is a fundamental challenge in computer vision, with broad applications in AR/VR, robotics, and digital content creation, but remains challenging under frequent occlusions in real-world settings. Existing regression-based methods are efficient but fragile to missing observations, while optimization- and diffusion-based approaches improve robustness at the cost of slow inference speed and heavy preprocessing steps. To address these limitations, we leverage recent advances in generative masked modeling and present MoRo: Masked Modeling for human motion Recovery under Occlusions. MoRo is an occlusion-robust, end-to-end generative framework that formulates motion reconstruction as a video-conditioned task, and efficiently recover human motion in a consistent global coordinate system from RGB videos. By masked modeling, MoRo naturally handles occlusions while enabling efficient, end-to-end inference. To overcome the scarcity of paired video-motion data, we design a cross-modality learning scheme that learns multi-modal priors from a set of heterogeneous datasets: (i) a trajectory-aware motion prior trained on MoCap datasets, (ii) an image-conditioned pose prior trained on image-pose datasets, capturing diverse per-frame poses, and (iii) a video-conditioned masked transformer that fuses motion and pose priors, finetuned on video-motion datasets to integrate visual cues with motion dynamics for robust inference. Extensive experiments on EgoBody and RICH demonstrate that MoRo substantially outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and motion realism under occlusions, while performing on-par in non-occluded scenarios. MoRo achieves real-time inference at 70 FPS on a single H200 GPU.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://mikeqzy.github.io/MoRo</p></details> |

The null distribution is valid in wide matrix elliptical model that includes, in particular, both matrix Gaussian and matrix $t$-distribution. The test is fast to compute and makes no assumptions about the component covariance matrices. An alternative, Wald-type version of the test is also proposed. Our simulations reveal that both versions of the test have good power even for heavier-tailed distributions and can compete with the Gaussian likelihood ratio test in the case of normal data.</p></details> | 21 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Fast, faithful and photorealistic diffusion-based image super-resolution with enhanced Flow Map models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16660v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) has recently attracted significant attention by leveraging the expressive power of large pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models (DMs). A central practical challenge is resolving the trade-off between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism. To address inference efficiency, many recent works have explored knowledge distillation strategies specifically tailored to SR, enabling one-step diffusion-based approaches. However, these teacher-student formulations are inherently constrained by information compression, which can degrade perceptual cues such as lifelike textures and depth of field, even with high overall perceptual quality. In parallel, self-distillation DMs, known as Flow Map models, have emerged as a promising alternative for image generation tasks, enabling fast inference while preserving the expressivity and training stability of standard DMs. Building on these developments, we propose FlowMapSR, a novel diffusion-based framework for image super-resolution explicitly designed for efficient inference. Beyond adapting Flow Map models to SR, we introduce two complementary enhancements: (i) positive-negative prompting guidance, based on a generalization of classifier free-guidance paradigm to Flow Map models, and (ii) adversarial fine-tuning using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Among the considered Flow Map formulations (Eulerian, Lagrangian, and Shortcut), we find that the Shortcut variant consistently achieves the best performance when combined with these enhancements. Extensive experiments show that FlowMapSR achieves a better balance between reconstruction faithfulness and photorealism than recent state-of-the-art methods for both x4 and x8 upscaling, while maintaining competitive inference time. Notably, a single model is used for both upscaling factors, without any scale-specific conditioning or degradation-guided mechanisms.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Kernel-Based Nonparametric Tests For Shape Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16745v3)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a kernel-based nonparametric framework for mean-variance optimization that enables inference on economically motivated shape constraints in finance, including positivity, monotonicity, and convexity. Many central hypotheses in financial econometrics are naturally expressed as shape relations on latent functions (e.g., term premia, CAPM relations, and the pricing kernel), yet enforcing such constraints during estimation can mask economically meaningful violations; our approach therefore separates learning from validation by first estimating an unconstrained solution and then testing shape properties. We establish statistical properties of the regularized sample estimator and derive rigorous guarantees, including asymptotic consistency, a functional central limit theorem, and a finite-sample deviation bound achieving the Monte Carlo rate up to a regularization term. Building on these results, we construct a joint Wald-type statistic to test shape constraints on finite grids. An efficient algorithm based on a pivoted Cholesky factorization yields scalability to large datasets. Numerical studies, including an options-based asset-pricing application, illustrate the usefulness of the proposed method for evaluating monotonicity and convexity restrictions.</p></details> | 40 pages, 4 figures |

Attempts were made by Mow over 30 years ago, but a comprehensive understanding to this problem is lacking. Our first key contribution is an explicit upper bound of generalized quadratic Gauss sums which is obtained by recursively applying Paris' asymptotic expansion and then bounding it by leveraging the fast convergence property of the Fibonacci zeta function. Building upon this major finding, our second key contribution includes four systematic constructions of order-optimal sequence sets with low aperiodic correlation and/or ambiguity properties via carefully selected Chu sequences and Alltop sequences. For the first time in the literature, we reveal that the full Alltop sequence set is asymptotically optimal for its low aperiodic correlation sidelobes. Besides, we introduce a novel subset of Alltop sequences possessing both order-optimal aperiodic correlation and ambiguity properties for the entire time-shift window.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory on 22 January 2026</p></details> |

This paper presents HumanDiffusion, a lightweight image-conditioned diffusion planner that generates human-aware navigation trajectories directly from RGB imagery. The system combines YOLO-11 based human detection with diffusion-driven trajectory generation, enabling a quadrotor to approach a target person and deliver medical assistance without relying on prior maps or computationally intensive planning pipelines. Trajectories are predicted in pixel space, ensuring smooth motion and a consistent safety margin around humans. We evaluate HumanDiffusion in simulation and real-world indoor mock-disaster scenarios. On a 300-sample test set, the model achieves a mean squared error of 0.02 in pixel-space trajectory reconstruction. Real-world experiments demonstrate an overall mission success rate of 80% across accident-response and search-and-locate tasks with partial occlusions. These results indicate that human-conditioned diffusion planning offers a practical and robust solution for human-aware UAV navigation in time-critical assistance settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at HRI, Late Breaking Report, 2026</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Joint Additive Factor Models for Multiview Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00778v4)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is increasingly common to collect data of multiple different types on the same set of samples. Our focus is on studying relationships between such multiview features and responses. A motivating application arises in the context of precision medicine where multi-omics data are collected to correlate with clinical outcomes. It is of interest to infer dependence within and across views while combining multimodal information to improve the prediction of outcomes. The signal-to-noise ratio can vary substantially across views, motivating more nuanced statistical tools beyond standard late and early fusion. This challenge comes with the need to preserve interpretability, select features, and obtain accurate uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we introduce two complementary factor regression models. A baseline Joint Factor Regression (\textsc{jfr}) captures combined variation across views via a single factor set, and a more nuanced Joint Additive FActor Regression (\textsc{jafar}) that decomposes variation into shared and view-specific components. For \textsc{jfr}, we use independent cumulative shrinkage process (\textsc{i-cusp}) priors, while for \textsc{jafar} we develop a dependent version (\textsc{d-cusp}) designed to ensure identifiability of the components. We develop Gibbs samplers that exploit the model structure and accommodate flexible feature and outcome distributions. Prediction of time-to-labor onset from immunome, metabolome, and proteome data illustrates performance gains against state-of-the-art competitors. Our open-source software (\texttt{R} package) is available at https://github.com/niccoloanceschi/jafar.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in Biometrics</p></details> |

Existing parameter regularization methods (e.g., O-LoRA, N-LoRA) mitigate interference via low-rank subspace orthogonality, but additive updates distort the intrinsic geometry of model parameters. We propose \textbf{OLieRA}, a Lie group based fine-tuning framework that preserves parameter geometry through multiplicative updates while enforcing orthogonality across task subspaces. OLieRA achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Standard CL benchmark and remains highly competitive under large task sequences. It further inherits the replay-free and task-ID free inference properties of O-LoRA, establishing a principled paradigm for continual learning in LLMs.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

However, most existing methods overlook the importance of the ability to continuously work in an ever-changing world, and lack the possibility of deployment on embodied systems in real-world environments. In this work, we introduce OnlineSI, a framework that can continuously improve its spatial understanding of its surroundings given a video stream. Our core idea is to maintain a finite spatial memory to retain past observations, ensuring the computation required for each inference does not increase as the input accumulates. We further integrate 3D point cloud information with semantic information, helping MLLM to better locate and identify objects in the scene. To evaluate our method, we introduce the Fuzzy $F_1$-Score to mitigate ambiguity, and test our method on two representative datasets. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, paving the way towards real-world embodied systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://onlinesi.github.io/</p></details> |

This diversity in objectives, modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified framework. To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing a Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship) explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants) analyzes AI applications in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the shift from "feeling" to "thinking and acting" and pinpointing key technologies like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only a systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona design space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the unique risks inherent in different application scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Neurips 2025 workshop: LLM Persona Workshop</p></details> |
| **[kNN-Graph: An adaptive graph model for $k$-nearest neighbors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16509v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm is a cornerstone of non-parametric classification in artificial intelligence, yet its deployment in large-scale applications is persistently constrained by the computational trade-off between inference speed and accuracy. Existing approximate nearest neighbor solutions accelerate retrieval but often degrade classification precision and lack adaptability in selecting the optimal neighborhood size (k). Here, we present an adaptive graph model that decouples inference latency from computational complexity. By integrating a Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) graph with a pre-computed voting mechanism, our framework completely transfers the computational burden of neighbor selection and weighting to the training phase. Within this topological structure, higher graph layers enable rapid navigation, while lower layers encode precise, node-specific decision boundaries with adaptive neighbor counts. Benchmarking against eight state-of-the-art baselines across six diverse datasets, we demonstrate that this architecture significantly accelerates inference speeds, achieving real-time performance, without compromising classification accuracy. These findings offer a scalable, robust solution to the long-standing inference bottleneck of kNN, establishing a new structural paradigm for graph-based nonparametric learning.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Are We Using the Right Benchmark: An Evaluation Framework for Visual Token Compression Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07143v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent efforts to accelerate inference in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have largely focused on visual token compression. The effectiveness of these methods is commonly evaluated by measuring the accuracy drop on existing MLLM benchmarks before and after compression. However, these benchmarks are originally designed to assess general perception and reasoning abilities, rather than the specific challenges posed by visual token compression, leading to a fundamental task mismatch. In this work, we uncover a counterintuitive yet consistent phenomenon: simple image downsampling outperforms many advanced visual token compression methods across multiple widely used benchmarks. Through a comprehensive empirical study spanning eight popular benchmarks and multiple state-of-the-art compression techniques, we show that (i) current benchmarks contain substantial noise (task-irrelevant samples) for evaluating visual token compression, and (ii) downsampling can act as an effective data filter that distinguishes between simple and difficult samples with respect to compression sensitivity. Motivated by these findings, we propose VTC-Bench, an evaluation framework that explicitly leverages downsampling as a discriminator to denoise existing benchmarks, enabling a fairer and more meaningful additional assessment of visual token compression methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/Chenfei-Liao/VTC-Bench; Project Page: https://chenfei-liao.github.io/VTC-Bench-Page/</p></details> |

However, in agentic scenarios with frequent tool calls, the traditional generation-length-based definition breaks down: tool latency decouples inference time from generation length. We propose Timely Machine, redefining test-time as wall-clock time, where models dynamically adjust strategies based on time budgets. We introduce Timely-Eval, a benchmark spanning high-frequency tool calls, low-frequency tool calls, and time-constrained reasoning. By varying tool latency, we find smaller models excel with fast feedback through more interactions, while larger models dominate high-latency settings via superior interaction quality. Moreover, existing models fail to adapt reasoning to time budgets. We propose Timely-RL to address this gap. After cold-start supervised fine-tuning, we use reinforcement learning to enhance temporal planning. Timely-RL improves time budget awareness and consistently boosts performance across Timely-Eval. We hope our work offers a new perspective on test-time scaling for the agentic era.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Mining Citywide Dengue Spread Patterns in Singapore Through Hotspot Dynamics from Open Web Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12856v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dengue, a mosquito-borne disease, continues to pose a persistent public health challenge in urban areas, particularly in tropical regions such as Singapore. Effective and affordable control requires anticipating where transmission risks are likely to emerge so that interventions can be deployed proactively rather than reactively. This study introduces a novel framework that uncovers and exploits latent transmission links between urban regions, mined directly from publicly available dengue case data. Instead of treating cases as isolated reports, we model how hotspot formation in one area is influenced by epidemic dynamics in neighboring regions. While mosquito movement is highly localized, long-distance transmission is often driven by human mobility, and in our case study, the learned network aligns closely with commuting flows, providing an interpretable explanation for citywide spread. These hidden links are optimized through gradient descent and used not only to forecast hotspot status but also to verify the consistency of spreading patterns, by examining the stability of the inferred network across consecutive weeks. Case studies on Singapore during 2013-2018 and 2020 show that four weeks of hotspot history are sufficient to achieve an average F-score of 0.79. Importantly, the learned transmission links align with commuting flows, highlighting the interpretable interplay between hidden epidemic spread and human mobility. By shifting from simply reporting dengue cases to mining and validating hidden spreading dynamics, this work transforms open web-based case data into a predictive and explanatory resource. The proposed framework advances epidemic modeling while providing a scalable, low-cost tool for public health planning, early intervention, and urban resilience.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures.

However, intelligent attacks represented by semantic eavesdropping pose severe challenges to the security of SemCom. To address this challenge, Semantic Steganographic Communication (SemSteCom) achieves ``invisible'' encryption by implicitly embedding private semantic information into cover modality carriers. The state-of-the-art study has further introduced generative diffusion models to directly generate stega images without relying on original cover images, effectively enhancing steganographic capacity. Nevertheless, the recovery process of private images is highly dependent on the guidance of private semantic keys, which may be inferred by intelligent eavesdroppers, thereby introducing new security threats. To address this issue, we propose an Agentic AI-driven SemSteCom (AgentSemSteCom) scheme, which includes semantic extraction, digital token controlled reference image generation, coverless steganography, semantic codec, and optional task-oriented enhancement modules. The proposed AgentSemSteCom scheme obviates the need for both cover images and private semantic keys, thereby boosting steganographic capacity while reinforcing transmission security. The simulation results on open-source datasets verify that, AgentSemSteCom achieves better transmission quality and higher security levels than the baseline scheme.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

Yet, existing studies focus on narrative or role-playing tasks and overlook how adversarial conversational history alone can reshape induced personas. Black-box persona manipulation remains unexplored, raising concerns for robustness in realistic interactions. In response, we introduce the task of persona editing, which adversarially steers LLM traits through user-side inputs under a black-box, inference-only setting. To this end, we propose PHISH (Persona Hijacking via Implicit Steering in History), the first framework to expose a new vulnerability in LLM safety that embeds semantically loaded cues into user queries to gradually induce reverse personas. We also define a metric to quantify attack success. Across 3 benchmarks and 8 LLMs, PHISH predictably shifts personas, triggers collateral changes in correlated traits, and exhibits stronger effects in multi-turn settings. In high-risk domains mental health, tutoring, and customer support, PHISH reliably manipulates personas, validated by both human and LLM-as-Judge evaluations. Importantly, PHISH causes only a small reduction in reasoning benchmark performance, leaving overall utility largely intact while still enabling significant persona manipulation. While current guardrails offer partial protection, they remain brittle under sustained attack. Our findings expose new vulnerabilities in personas and highlight the need for context-resilient persona in LLMs. Our codebase and dataset is available at: https://github.com/Jivnesh/PHISH</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL26 (Findings)</p></details> |

However, existing real-time HAR systems face significant challenges, including limited scalability and high computational costs arising from redundant features. To address these issues, the Inception-V3 model was customized with region-based and boundary-aware operations, using average pooling and max pooling, respectively, to enhance region homogeneity, suppress noise, and capture discriminative local features, while improving robustness through down-sampling. Furthermore, to effectively encode motion dynamics, an Attention-Augmented Long Short-Term Memory (AA-LSTM) network was employed to learn temporal dependencies across video frames. Features are extracted from video dataset and are then optimized through a novel proposed dynamic composite feature selection method called Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA). This ADFSA mechanism is embedded within a genetic algorithm to select a compact, optimized subset of features by dynamically balancing multiple objectives, accuracy, redundancy reduction, feature uniqueness, and complexity minimization. As a result, the selected subset of diverse and discriminative features enables lightweight machine learning classifiers to achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental results demonstrate up to 99.65\% accuracy using as few as seven selected features, with improved inference time on the challenging UCF-YouTube dataset, which includes factors such as occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, complex motion dynamics, and poor illumination conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 25 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
