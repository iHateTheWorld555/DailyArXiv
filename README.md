| **[RedSage: A Cybersecurity Generalist LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22159v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cybersecurity operations demand assistant LLMs that support diverse workflows without exposing sensitive data. Existing solutions either rely on proprietary APIs with privacy risks or on open models lacking domain adaptation. To bridge this gap, we curate 11.8B tokens of cybersecurity-focused continual pretraining data via large-scale web filtering and manual collection of high-quality resources, spanning 28.6K documents across frameworks, offensive techniques, and security tools. Building on this, we design an agentic augmentation pipeline that simulates expert workflows to generate 266K multi-turn cybersecurity samples for supervised fine-tuning. Combined with general open-source LLM data, these resources enable the training of RedSage, an open-source, locally deployable cybersecurity assistant with domain-aware pretraining and post-training. To rigorously evaluate the models, we introduce RedSage-Bench, a benchmark with 30K multiple-choice and 240 open-ended Q&A items covering cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and tool expertise. RedSage is further evaluated on established cybersecurity benchmarks (e.g., CTI-Bench, CyberMetric, SECURE) and general LLM benchmarks to assess broader generalization. At the 8B scale, RedSage achieves consistently better results, surpassing the baseline models by up to +5.59 points on cybersecurity benchmarks and +5.05 points on Open LLM Leaderboard tasks. These findings demonstrate that domain-aware agentic augmentation and pre/post-training can not only enhance cybersecurity-specific expertise but also help to improve general reasoning and instruction-following. All models, datasets, and code are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted on ICLR 2026; Project page: https://risys-lab.github.io/RedSage/</p></details> |
| **[One-step Latent-free Image Generation with Pixel Mean Flows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22158v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern diffusion/flow-based models for image generation typically exhibit two core characteristics: (i) using multi-step sampling, and (ii) operating in a latent space. Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.</p></details> | Technical report |
| **[Hybrid Linear Attention Done Right: Efficient Distillation and Effective Architectures for Extremely Long Contexts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22156v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hybrid Transformer architectures, which combine softmax attention blocks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown a desirable performance-throughput tradeoff for long-context modeling, but their adoption and studies are hindered by the prohibitive cost of large-scale pre-training from scratch. Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency. The conversion requires just 2.3B tokens, less than 0.01% of their pre-training data</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Exploring Reasoning Reward Model for Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22154v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Reinforcement Learning (Agentic RL) has achieved notable success in enabling agents to perform complex reasoning and tool use. However, most methods still relies on sparse outcome-based reward for training. Such feedback fails to differentiate intermediate reasoning quality, leading to suboptimal training results. In this paper, we introduce Agent Reasoning Reward Model (Agent-RRM), a multi-faceted reward model that produces structured feedback for agentic trajectories, including (1) an explicit reasoning trace , (2) a focused critique that provides refinement guidance by highlighting reasoning flaws, and (3) an overall score that evaluates process performance. Leveraging these signals, we systematically investigate three integration strategies: Reagent-C (text-augmented refinement), Reagent-R (reward-augmented guidance), and Reagent-U (unified feedback integration). Extensive evaluations across 12 diverse benchmarks demonstrate that Reagent-U yields substantial performance leaps, achieving 43.7% on GAIA and 46.2% on WebWalkerQA, validating the effectiveness of our reasoning reward model and training schemes. Code, models, and datasets are all released to facilitate future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/kxfan2002/Reagent</p></details> |
| **[DynamicVLA: A Vision-Language-Action Model for Dynamic Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22153v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulating dynamic objects remains an open challenge for Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which, despite strong generalization in static manipulation, struggle in dynamic scenarios requiring rapid perception, temporal anticipation, and continuous control. We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.infinitescript.com/project/dynamic-vla/ GitHub: https://github.com/hzxie/DynamicVLA</p></details> |
| **[Late Breaking Results: Conversion of Neural Networks into Logic Flows for Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22151v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have been successfully applied in various resource-constrained edge devices, where usually central processing units (CPUs) instead of graphics processing units exist due to limited power availability. State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the latency can be reduced by up to 14.9 % on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any accuracy degradation. The code is open source at https://github.com/TUDa-HWAI/NN2Logic</p></details> | accepted by DATE2026 |
| **[Do VLMs Perceive or Recall? Probing Visual Perception vs. Memory with Classic Visual Illusions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22150v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often answer classic visual illusions "correctly" on original images, yet persist with the same responses when illusion factors are inverted, even though the visual change is obvious to humans. This raises a fundamental question: do VLMs perceive visual changes or merely recall memorized patterns? While several studies have noted this phenomenon, the underlying causes remain unclear. To move from observations to systematic understanding, this paper introduces VI-Probe, a controllable visual-illusion framework with graded perturbations and matched visual controls (without illusion inducer) that disentangles visually grounded perception from language-driven recall. Unlike prior work that focuses on averaged accuracy, we measure stability and sensitivity using Polarity-Flip Consistency, Template Fixation Index, and an illusion multiplier normalized against matched controls. Experiments across different families reveal that response persistence arises from heterogeneous causes rather than a single mechanism. For instance, GPT-5 exhibits memory override, Claude-Opus-4.1 shows perception-memory competition, while Qwen variants suggest visual-processing limits. Our findings challenge single-cause views and motivate probing-based evaluation that measures both knowledge and sensitivity to controlled visual change.

| **[Think Twice: Branch-and-Rethink Reasoning Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23596v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on thinking models that externalize intermediate steps and allocate extra test-time compute, with think-twice strategies showing that a deliberate second pass can elicit stronger reasoning. In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-once scoring into focused, second-look reasoning, BR-RM reduces judgment diffusion and improves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source Code: https://github.com/yzjiao/BR-RM.

| **[JUST-DUB-IT: Video Dubbing via Joint Audio-Visual Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22143v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Audio-Visual Foundation Models, which are pretrained to jointly generate sound and visual content, have recently shown an unprecedented ability to model multi-modal generation and editing, opening new opportunities for downstream tasks. Among these tasks, video dubbing could greatly benefit from such priors, yet most existing solutions still rely on complex, task-specific pipelines that struggle in real-world settings. In this work, we introduce a single-model approach that adapts a foundational audio-video diffusion model for video-to-video dubbing via a lightweight LoRA. The LoRA enables the model to condition on an input audio-video while jointly generating translated audio and synchronized facial motion. To train this LoRA, we leverage the generative model itself to synthesize paired multilingual videos of the same speaker. Specifically, we generate multilingual videos with language switches within a single clip, and then inpaint the face and audio in each half to match the language of the other half. By leveraging the rich generative prior of the audio-visual model, our approach preserves speaker identity and lip synchronization while remaining robust to complex motion and real-world dynamics. We demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality dubbed videos with improved visual fidelity, lip synchronization, and robustness compared to existing dubbing pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project webpage available at https://justdubit.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Reasoning While Asking: Transforming Reasoning Large Language Models from Passive Solvers to Proactive Inquirers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22139v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, yet they remain fundamentally limited by a \emph{blind self-thinking} paradigm: performing extensive internal reasoning even when critical information is missing or ambiguous. We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\% higher accuracy, 22.90\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

| **[PI-Light: Physics-Inspired Diffusion for Full-Image Relighting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22135v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Full-image relighting remains a challenging problem due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale structured paired data, the difficulty of maintaining physical plausibility, and the limited generalizability imposed by data-driven priors. Existing attempts to bridge the synthetic-to-real gap for full-scene relighting remain suboptimal. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Physics-Inspired diffusion for full-image reLight ($π$-Light, or PI-Light), a two-stage framework that leverages physics-inspired diffusion models. Our design incorporates (i) batch-aware attention, which improves the consistency of intrinsic predictions across a collection of images, (ii) a physics-guided neural rendering module that enforces physically plausible light transport, (iii) physics-inspired losses that regularize training dynamics toward a physically meaningful landscape, thereby enhancing generalizability to real-world image editing, and (iv) a carefully curated dataset of diverse objects and scenes captured under controlled lighting conditions. Together, these components enable efficient finetuning of pretrained diffusion models while also providing a solid benchmark for downstream evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that $π$-Light synthesizes specular highlights and diffuse reflections across a wide variety of materials, achieving superior generalization to real-world scenes compared with prior approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[SMOG: Scalable Meta-Learning for Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22131v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-objective optimization aims to solve problems with competing objectives, often with only black-box access to a problem and a limited budget of measurements. In many applications, historical data from related optimization tasks is available, creating an opportunity for meta-learning to accelerate the optimization. Bayesian optimization, as a promising technique for black-box optimization, has been extended to meta-learning and multi-objective optimization independently, but methods that simultaneously address both settings - meta-learned priors for multi-objective Bayesian optimization - remain largely unexplored. We propose SMOG, a scalable and modular meta-learning model based on a multi-output Gaussian process that explicitly learns correlations between objectives. SMOG builds a structured joint Gaussian process prior across meta- and target tasks and, after conditioning on metadata, yields a closed-form target-task prior augmented by a flexible residual multi-output kernel. This construction propagates metadata uncertainty into the target surrogate in a principled way. SMOG supports hierarchical, parallel training: meta-task Gaussian processes are fit once and then cached, achieving linear scaling with the number of meta-tasks. The resulting surrogate integrates seamlessly with standard multi-objective Bayesian optimization acquisition functions.</p></details> | 19 pages, 15 figures |
| **[EditYourself: Audio-Driven Generation and Manipulation of Talking Head Videos with Diffusion Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22127v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current generative video models excel at producing novel content from text and image prompts, but leave a critical gap in editing existing pre-recorded videos, where minor alterations to the spoken script require preserving motion, temporal coherence, speaker identity, and accurate lip synchronization. We introduce EditYourself, a DiT-based framework for audio-driven video-to-video (V2V) editing that enables transcript-based modification of talking head videos, including the seamless addition, removal, and retiming of visually spoken content. Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations. This work represents a foundational step toward generative video models as practical tools for professional video post-production.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://edit-yourself.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Creative Image Generation with Diffusion Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22125v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Creative image generation has emerged as a compelling area of research, driven by the need to produce novel and high-quality images that expand the boundaries of imagination. In this work, we propose a novel framework for creative generation using diffusion models, where creativity is associated with the inverse probability of an image's existence in the CLIP embedding space. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a manual blending of concepts or exclusion of subcategories, our method calculates the probability distribution of generated images and drives it towards low-probability regions to produce rare, imaginative, and visually captivating outputs. We also introduce pullback mechanisms, achieving high creativity without sacrificing visual fidelity. Extensive experiments on text-to-image diffusion models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our creative generation framework, showcasing its ability to produce unique, novel, and thought-provoking images. This work provides a new perspective on creativity in generative models, offering a principled method to foster innovation in visual content synthesis.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://creative-t2i.github.io</p></details> |
| **[A Federated and Parameter-Efficient Framework for Large Language Model Training in Medicine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22124v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on medical benchmarks, including question answering and diagnosis. To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |
| **[Alpha Discovery via Grammar-Guided Learning and Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22119v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically discovering formulaic alpha factors is a central problem in quantitative finance. Existing methods often ignore syntactic and semantic constraints, relying on exhaustive search over unstructured and unbounded spaces. We present AlphaCFG, a grammar-based framework for defining and discovering alpha factors that are syntactically valid, financially interpretable, and computationally efficient. AlphaCFG uses an alpha-oriented context-free grammar to define a tree-structured, size-controlled search space, and formulates alpha discovery as a tree-structured linguistic Markov decision process, which is then solved using a grammar-aware Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by syntax-sensitive value and policy networks. Experiments on Chinese and U.S. stock market datasets show that AlphaCFG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both search efficiency and trading profitability. Beyond trading strategies, AlphaCFG serves as a general framework for symbolic factor discovery and refinement across quantitative finance, including asset pricing and portfolio construction.</p></details> | 24 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Diverse Approaches to Optimal Execution Schedule Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22113v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first application of MAP-Elites, a quality-diversity algorithm, to trade execution. Rather than searching for a single optimal policy, MAP-Elites generates a diverse portfolio of regime-specialist strategies indexed by liquidity and volatility conditions. Individual specialists achieve 8-10% performance improvements within their behavioural niches, while other cells show degradation, suggesting opportunities for ensemble approaches that combine improved specialists with the baseline PPO policy. Results indicate that quality-diversity methods offer promise for regime-adaptive execution, though substantial computational resources per behavioural cell may be required for robust specialist development across all market conditions. To ensure experimental integrity, we develop a calibrated Gymnasium environment focused on order scheduling rather than tactical placement decisions. The simulator features a transient impact model with exponential decay and square-root volume scaling, fit to 400+ U.S. equities with R^2>0.02 out-of-sample. Within this environment, two Proximal Policy Optimization architectures - both MLP and CNN feature extractors - demonstrate substantial improvements over industry baselines, with the CNN variant achieving 2.13 bps arrival slippage versus 5.23 bps for VWAP on 4,900 out-of-sample orders ($21B notional). These results validate both the simulation realism and provide strong single-policy baselines for quality-diversity methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 15 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Current evaluations heavily rely on inefficient and costly human judgments, hindering progress in enhancing machine creativity. While automated methods exist, ranging from psychological testing to heuristic- or prompting-based approaches, they often lack generalizability or alignment with human judgment. To address these issues, we propose a novel pairwise-comparison framework for assessing textual creativity that leverages shared contextual instructions to improve evaluation consistency. We introduce CreataSet, a large-scale dataset with 100K+ human-level and 1M+ synthetic creative instruction-response pairs spanning diverse open-domain tasks. Through training on CreataSet, we develop an LLM-based evaluator named CrEval. CrEval demonstrates remarkable superiority over existing methods in alignment with human judgments. Experimental results underscore the indispensable significance of integrating both human and synthetic data to train highly robust evaluators, and showcase the practical utility of CrEval in boosting the creativity of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Relating the growth of a graph to a coordinate descent process, we characterise the fully-corrective descents corresponding to information-optimal growths, and propose numerically efficient strategies for their approximation. We demonstrate the ability of the proposed procedures to reliably extract sparse graphical models while limiting the number of false detections, and illustrate how activation ranks can provide insight into the informational relevance of edge sets. The considered approaches are tuning-parameter-free and have complexities akin to coordinate descents.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Social Media Data for Population Mapping: A Bayesian Approach to Address Representativeness and Privacy Challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22104v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate and timely population data are essential for disaster response and humanitarian planning, but traditional censuses often cannot capture rapid demographic changes. Social media data offer a promising alternative for dynamic population monitoring, but their representativeness remains poorly understood and stringent privacy requirements limit their reliability. Here, we address these limitations in the context of the Philippines by calibrating Facebook user counts with the country's 2020 census figures. First, we find that differential privacy techniques commonly applied to social media-based population datasets disproportionately mask low-population areas. To address this, we propose a Bayesian imputation approach to recover missing values, restoring data coverage for $5.5\%$ of rural areas. Further, using the imputed social media data and leveraging predictors such as urbanisation level, demographic composition, and socio-economic status, we develop a statistical model for the proportion of Facebook users in each municipality, which links observed Facebook user numbers to the true population levels. Out-of-sample validation demonstrates strong result generalisability, with errors as low as ${\approx}18\%$ and ${\approx}24\%$ for urban and rural Facebook user proportions, respectively. We further demonstrate that accounting for overdispersion and spatial correlations in the data is crucial to obtain accurate estimates and appropriate credible intervals. Crucially, as predictors change over time, the models can be used to regularly update the population predictions, providing a dynamic complement to census-based estimates. These results have direct implications for humanitarian response in disaster-prone regions and offer a general framework for using biased social media signals to generate reliable and timely population data.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

Explainability techniques (XAI) have made remarkable progress in the interpretability of ML models. However, the non-euclidean nature of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) makes it difficult to reuse already existing XAI methods. While other works have focused on instance-based explanation methods for GNNs, very few have investigated model-based methods and, to our knowledge, none have tried to probe the embedding of the GNNs for structural graph properties. In this paper we present a model agnostic explainability pipeline for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) employing diagnostic classifiers. We propose to consider graph-theoretic properties as the features of choice for studying the emergence of representations in GNNs. This pipeline aims to probe and interpret the learned representations in GNNs across various architectures and datasets, refining our understanding and trust in these models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 22 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Martingale Estimators: Structured Estimators for Maximizing Information Freshness in Query-Based Update Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22098v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates information freshness in a remote estimation system in which the remote information source is a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). For such systems, estimators have been mainly restricted to the class of martingale estimators in which the remote estimate at any time is equal to the value of the most recently received update. This is mainly due to the simplicity and ease of analysis of martingale estimators, which however are far from optimal, especially in query-based (i.e., pull-based) update systems. In such systems, maximum a-posteriori probability (MAP) estimators are optimal. However, MAP estimators can be challenging to analyze in continuous-time settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of estimators, called structured estimators, which can seamlessly shift from a martingale estimator to a MAP estimator, enabling them to retain useful characteristics of the MAP estimate, while still being analytically tractable. Particularly, we introduce a new estimator termed as the $p$-MAP estimator which is a piecewise-constant approximation of the MAP estimator with finitely many discontinuities, bringing us closer to a full characterization of MAP estimators when modeling information freshness. In fact, we show that for time-reversible CTMCs, the MAP estimator reduces to a $p$-MAP estimator. Using the binary freshness (BF) process for the characterization of information freshness, we derive the freshness expressions and provide optimal state-dependent sampling policies (i.e., querying policies) for maximizing the mean BF (MBF) for pull-based remote estimation of a single CTMC information source, when structured estimators are used. Moreover, we provide optimal query rate allocation policies when a monitor pulls information from multiple heterogeneous CTMCs with a constraint on the overall query rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2601.18763</p></details> |

In this work, we rethink these approaches through the lens of manifold optimization, interpreting the outputs of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) and attention layers as update directions in optimization. Building on this perspective, we introduce GeoNorm, a novel method that replaces standard normalization with geodesic updates on the manifold. Furthermore, analogous to learning rate schedules, we propose a layer-wise update decay for the FFN and attention components. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that GeoNorm consistently outperforms existing normalization methods in Transformer models. Crucially, GeoNorm can be seamlessly integrated into standard Transformer architectures, achieving performance improvements with negligible additional computational cost.</p></details> | Tech Report |

Existing reference-based image generation methods leverage large-scale pretrained diffusion models and demonstrate strong capability in generating diverse images conditioned on a single reference image. However, these methods are limited to single-image references and cannot leverage 3D assets, constraining their practical versatility. To address this gap, we present a cross-domain diffusion model with dual-branch perception that leverages multi-view RGB images and point maps of 3D assets to jointly model their colors and canonical-space coordinates, achieving precise consistency between generated images and the 3D references. Our spatially aligned dual-branch generation architecture and domain-decoupled generation mechanism ensure the simultaneous generation of two spatially aligned but content-disentangled outputs, RGB images and point maps, linking 2D image attributes with 3D asset attributes. Experiments show that our approach effectively uses 3D assets as references to produce images consistent with the given assets, opening new possibilities for combining diffusion models with 3D content creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026.

Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, appendix</p></details> |

While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalization capabilities on unseen geometric configurations, highlighting both its potential for controlled simulation synthesis and current limitations in spatial precision for out-of-distribution samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 18 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Diagnosing Inference Energy Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22076v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.</p></details> | <details><summary>The M...</summary><p>The ML.ENERGY Leaderboard v3.0 is open https://ml.energy/leaderboard</p></details> |

The generative AI revolution would seem to explode this assumption, given the critical role stochastic inference plays. Yet, in spite of public demand for more transparency in AI -- along with strong evidence that humans are unreliable judges -- estimates of model reliability are conventionally based on, at most, a few output responses per input item. We adapt a method, previously used to evaluate the reliability of various metrics and estimators for machine learning evaluation, to determine whether an (existing or planned) dataset has enough responses per item to assure reliable null hypothesis statistical testing. We show that, for many common metrics, collecting even 5-10 responses per item (from each model and team of human evaluators) is not sufficient. We apply our methods to several of the very few extant gold standard test sets with multiple disaggregated responses per item and show that even these datasets lack enough responses per item. We show how our methods can help AI researchers make better decisions about how to collect data for AI evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL Findings 2026</p></details> |

Yet, due to resource constraints, tiny aerial robots, perfectly suited for these operations, are unable to navigate in the darkness to find survivors safely. In this paper, we present an autonomous aerial robot for navigation in the dark by combining an Infra-Red (IR) monocular camera with a large-aperture coded lens and structured light without external infrastructure like GPS or motion-capture. Our approach obtains depth-dependent defocus cues (each structured light point appears as a pattern that is depth dependent), which acts as a strong prior for our AsterNet deep depth estimation model. The model is trained in simulation by generating data using a simple optical model and transfers directly to the real world without any fine-tuning or retraining. AsterNet runs onboard the robot at 20 Hz on an NVIDIA Jetson Orin$^\text{TM}$ Nano. Furthermore, our network is robust to changes in the structured light pattern and relative placement of the pattern emitter and IR camera, leading to simplified and cost-effective construction. We successfully evaluate and demonstrate our proposed depth navigation approach AsterNav using depth from AsterNet in many real-world experiments using only onboard sensing and computation, including dark matte obstacles and thin ropes (diameter 6.25mm), achieving an overall success rate of 95.5% with unknown object shapes, locations and materials. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on monocular, structured-light-based quadrotor navigation in absolute darkness.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 10 figures, Published in IEEE Robotics And Automation Letters</p></details> |

Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as "optical memory." We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

Existing approaches either ignore structural context or rely on expensive, memory-intensive encoding that limits throughput and scalability. We present SiDGen (Structure-informed Diffusion Generator), a protein-conditioned diffusion framework that integrates masked SMILES generation with lightweight folding-derived features for pocket awareness. To balance expressivity with efficiency, SiDGen supports two conditioning pathways: a streamlined mode that pools coarse structural signals from protein embeddings and a full mode that injects localized pairwise biases for stronger coupling. A coarse-stride folding mechanism with nearest-neighbor upsampling alleviates the quadratic memory costs of pair tensors, enabling training on realistic sequence lengths. Learning stability is maintained through in-loop chemical validity checks and an invalidity penalty, while large-scale training efficiency is restored \textit{via} selective compilation, dataloader tuning, and gradient accumulation. In automated benchmarks, SiDGen generates ligands with high validity, uniqueness, and novelty, while achieving competitive performance in docking-based evaluations and maintaining reasonable molecular properties. These results demonstrate that SiDGen can deliver scalable, pocket-aware molecular design, providing a practical route to conditional generation for high-throughput drug discovery.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |

We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 16 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Corrective Diffusion Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15596v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) are theoretically well-suited for iterative refinement due to their non-causal structure, they often fail to reliably revise incorrect tokens in practice. The key challenge lies in the model's inability to distinguish between correct and erroneous tokens in a visible sequence. Standard masked diffusion language model (MDLM) training is restricted to the objective of unmasking, undermining the effectiveness of refinement guided by confidence. Based on this observation, we study corrective behavior in DLMs, defined as the ability to assign lower confidence to incorrect tokens and iteratively refine them while preserving correct content. We show that this capability is not induced by conventional masked diffusion objectives and propose a post-training principle oriented by correction that explicitly supervises visible incorrect tokens, enabling discriminative confidence and targeted refinement. To evaluate corrective behavior, we introduce the Code Revision Benchmark, a controllable and executable benchmark for assessing error localization and in-place correction. Experiments on code revision tasks and parallel decoding scenarios demonstrate that models trained with our approach substantially outperform standard MDLMs, with gains that are most pronounced when parallel decoding introduces substantial uncertainty and iterative refinement becomes essential.

We introduce Metric Anything, a simple and scalable pretraining framework that learns metric depth from noisy, diverse 3D sources without manually engineered prompts, camera-specific modeling, or task-specific architectures. Central to our approach is the Sparse Metric Prompt, created by randomly masking depth maps, which serves as a universal interface that decouples spatial reasoning from sensor and camera biases. Using about 20M image-depth pairs spanning reconstructed, captured, and rendered 3D data across 10000 camera models, we demonstrate-for the first time-a clear scaling trend in the metric depth track. The pretrained model excels at prompt-driven tasks such as depth completion, super-resolution and Radar-camera fusion, while its distilled prompt-free student achieves state-of-the-art results on monocular depth estimation, camera intrinsics recovery, single/multi-view metric 3D reconstruction, and VLA planning. We also show that using pretrained ViT of Metric Anything as a visual encoder significantly boosts Multimodal Large Language Model capabilities in spatial intelligence. These results show that metric depth estimation can benefit from the same scaling laws that drive modern foundation models, establishing a new path toward scalable and efficient real-world metric perception. We open-source MetricAnything at http://metric-anything.github.io/metric-anything-io/ to support community research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://metric-anything.github.io/metric-anything-io/</p></details> |

We study a heterogeneous multi-step binary communication game where agents differ in modality and lack perceptual grounding. Despite perceptual misalignment, multimodal systems converge to class-consistent messages grounded in perceptual input. Unimodal systems communicate more efficiently, using fewer bits and achieving lower classification entropy, while multimodal agents require greater information exchange and exhibit higher uncertainty. Bit perturbation experiments provide strong evidence that meaning is encoded in a distributional rather than compositional manner, as each bit's contribution depends on its surrounding pattern. Finally, interoperability analyses show that systems trained in different perceptual worlds fail to directly communicate, but limited fine-tuning enables successful cross-system communication. This work positions emergent communication as a framework for studying how agents adapt and transfer representations across heterogeneous modalities, opening new directions for both theory and experimentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in EvoLang XVI proceedings. 15 pages, 17 figures</p></details> |

Since clusters serve as their own control, the CRXO design is typically more statistically efficient than the usual parallel-arm design. CRXO trials are increasingly popular in many areas of health research where the number of available clusters is limited. Further, in trials among severely ill patients, researchers often want to assess the effect of treatments on secondary non-terminal outcomes, but frequently in these studies, there are patients who do not survive to have these measurements fully recorded. In this paper, we provide a causal inference framework and treatment effect estimation methods for addressing truncation by death in the setting of CRXO trials. We target the survivor average causal effect (SACE) estimand, a well-defined subgroup treatment effect obtained via principal stratification. We propose novel structural and standard modeling assumptions that enable estimating the SACE within a Bayesian paradigm. We evaluate the small-sample performance of our proposed Bayesian approach for estimation of the SACE in CRXO trial settings via simulation studies. We apply our methods to a previously conducted two-period cross-sectional CRXO study examining the impact of proton pump inhibitors compared to histamine-2 receptor blockers on length of hospitalization among adults requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.</p></details> | <details><summary>corre...</summary><p>corrected minor writing errors (including in abstract) and typos</p></details> |

Recent advances have made encouraging progress on each aspect individually, paving the way toward one-step diffusion/flow without latents. In this work, we take a further step towards this goal and propose "pixel MeanFlow" (pMF). Our core guideline is to formulate the network output space and the loss space separately. The network target is designed to be on a presumed low-dimensional image manifold (i.e., x-prediction), while the loss is defined via MeanFlow in the velocity space. We introduce a simple transformation between the image manifold and the average velocity field. In experiments, pMF achieves strong results for one-step latent-free generation on ImageNet at 256x256 resolution (2.22 FID) and 512x512 resolution (2.48 FID), filling a key missing piece in this regime. We hope that our study will further advance the boundaries of diffusion/flow-based generative models.</p></details> | Technical report |

Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency. The conversion requires just 2.3B tokens, less than 0.01% of their pre-training data</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Late Breaking Results: Conversion of Neural Networks into Logic Flows for Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22151v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural networks have been successfully applied in various resource-constrained edge devices, where usually central processing units (CPUs) instead of graphics processing units exist due to limited power availability. State-of-the-art research still focuses on efficiently executing enormous numbers of multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations. However, CPUs themselves are not good at executing such mathematical operations on a large scale, since they are more suited to execute control flow logic, i.e., computer algorithms. To enhance the computation efficiency of neural networks on CPUs, in this paper, we propose to convert them into logic flows for execution. Specifically, neural networks are first converted into equivalent decision trees, from which decision paths with constant leaves are then selected and compressed into logic flows. Such logic flows consist of if and else structures and a reduced number of MAC operations. Experimental results demonstrate that the latency can be reduced by up to 14.9 % on a simulated RISC-V CPU without any accuracy degradation.

In contrast, most reward models (RMs) still compress many quality dimensions into a single scalar in one shot, a design that induces judgment diffusion: attention spreads across evaluation criteria, yielding diluted focus and shallow analysis. We introduce branch-and-rethink (BR-RM), a two-turn RM that transfers the think-twice principle to reward modeling. Turn 1 performs adaptive branching, selecting a small set of instance-critical dimensions (such as factuality and safety) and sketching concise, evidence-seeking hypotheses. Turn 2 executes branch-conditioned rethinking, a targeted reread that tests those hypotheses and scrutinizes only what matters most. We train with GRPO-style reinforcement learning over structured two-turn traces using a simple binary outcome reward with strict format checks, making the approach compatible with standard RLHF pipelines. By converting all-at-once scoring into focused, second-look reasoning, BR-RM reduces judgment diffusion and improves sensitivity to subtle yet consequential errors while remaining practical and scalable. Experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three challenging reward modeling benchmarks across diverse domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source Code: https://github.com/yzjiao/BR-RM.

We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\% higher accuracy, 22.90\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

Building on a general-purpose video diffusion model, EditYourself augments its V2V capabilities with audio conditioning and region-aware, edit-focused training extensions. This enables precise lip synchronization and temporally coherent restructuring of existing performances via spatiotemporal inpainting, including the synthesis of realistic human motion in newly added segments, while maintaining visual fidelity and identity consistency over long durations.

To enable their use in clinical settings, LLMs are typically further adapted through continued pretraining or post-training using clinical data. However, most medical LLMs are trained on data from a single institution, which faces limitations in generalizability and safety in heterogeneous systems. Federated learning (FL) is a promising solution for enabling collaborative model development across healthcare institutions. Yet applying FL to LLMs in medicine remains fundamentally limited. First, conventional FL requires transmitting the full model during each communication round, which becomes impractical for multi-billion-parameter LLMs given the limited computational resources. Second, many FL algorithms implicitly assume data homogeneity, whereas real-world clinical data are highly heterogeneous across patients, diseases, and institutional practices. We introduce the model-agnostic and parameter-efficient federated learning framework for adapting LLMs to medical applications. Fed-MedLoRA transmits only low-rank adapter parameters, reducing communication and computation overhead, while Fed-MedLoRA+ further incorporates adaptive, data-aware aggregation to improve convergence under cross-site heterogeneity. We apply the framework to clinical information extraction (IE), which transforms patient narratives into structured medical entities and relations. Accuracy was assessed across five patient cohorts through comparisons with BERT models, and LLaMA-3 and DeepSeek-R1, GPT-4o models. Evaluation settings included (1) in-domain training and testing, (2) external validation on independent cohorts, and (3) a low-resource new-site adaptation scenario using real-world clinical notes from the Yale New Haven Health System.</p></details> | <details><summary>38 pa...</summary><p>38 pages, 9 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

To enable teamwork, teams must transform these representations by modifying or re-creating them into accessible forms. However, these transformations are frequently overlooked, lack infrastructural support, and cause additional labour. To design systems that move beyond one-off accommodations to effective mixed-ability collaboration, we need a deeper understanding of the representations, their transformations and how they occur. We conducted a week-long diary study with follow-up interviews with 23 BLV and sighted professionals from five legal, non-profit, and consulting teams, documenting 36 transformation cases. Our analysis characterizes how teams perform representational transformations for accessibility: how they are triggered proactively or reactively, how they simplify or enhance, and four common patterns in which workers coordinate with each other to address representational incompatibility. Our findings uncover opportunities for designing systems that can better support mixed-visual ability work.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACM CHI 2026.

In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as "optical memory." We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

The majority of articles in this literature considers a (plain) feed forward neural network architecture in order to connect the neurons used for learning the function mapping inputs to outputs. In this article, motivated by methods in image classification and recent advances in machine learning methods for PDEs, we investigate empirically whether and how the choice of network architecture affects the accuracy and training time of a machine learning algorithm. We find that the generalized highway network architecture achieves the best performance, when considering the mean squared error and the training time as criteria, within the considered parameter budgets for the Black-Scholes and Heston option pricing problems. Considering the transformed implied volatility problem, a simplified DGM variant achieves the lowest error among the tested architectures. We also carry out a capacity-normalised comparison for completeness, where all architectures are evaluated with an equal number of parameters. Finally, for the implied volatility problem, we additionally include experiments using real market data.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 27 figures, 23 tables, revised version.

| **[Exploring Diverse Generation Paths via Inference-time Stiefel Activation Steering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22010v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models often default to a narrow set of high-probability outputs, leaving their generation paths homogeneous and prone to mode collapse. Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Causal World Modeling for Robot Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21998v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work highlights that video world modeling, alongside vision-language pre-training, establishes a fresh and independent foundation for robot learning. Intuitively, video world models provide the ability to imagine the near future by understanding the causality between actions and visual dynamics. Inspired by this, we introduce LingBot-VA, an autoregressive diffusion framework that learns frame prediction and policy execution simultaneously. Our model features three carefully crafted designs: (1) a shared latent space, integrating vision and action tokens, driven by a Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) architecture, (2) a closed-loop rollout mechanism, allowing for ongoing acquisition of environmental feedback with ground-truth observations, (3) an asynchronous inference pipeline, parallelizing action prediction and motor execution to support efficient control. We evaluate our model on both simulation benchmarks and real-world scenarios, where it shows significant promise in long-horizon manipulation, data efficiency in post-training, and strong generalizability to novel configurations. The code and model are made publicly available to facilitate the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://technology.robbyant.com/lingbot-va Code: https://github.com/robbyant/lingbot-va</p></details> |
| **[From Generative Modeling to Clinical Classification: A GPT-Based Architecture for EHR Notes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21955v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing availability of unstructured clinical narratives in electronic health records (EHRs) has created new opportunities for automated disease characterization, cohort identification, and clinical decision support. However, modeling long, domain-specific clinical text remains challenging due to limited labeled data, severe class imbalance, and the high computational cost of adapting large pretrained language models. This study presents a GPT-based architecture for clinical text classification that adapts a pretrained decoder-only Transformer using a selective fine-tuning strategy. Rather than updating all model parameters, the majority of the GPT-2 backbone is frozen, and training is restricted to the final Transformer block, the final layer normalization, and a lightweight classification head. This approach substantially reduces the number of trainable parameters while preserving the representational capacity required to model complex clinical language. The proposed method is evaluated on radiology reports from the MIMIC-IV-Note dataset using uncertainty-aware CheXpert-style labels derived directly from report text. Experiments cover multiple problem formulations, including multi-label classification of radiographic findings, binary per-label classification under different uncertainty assumptions, and aggregate disease outcome prediction. Across varying dataset sizes, the model exhibits stable convergence behavior and strong classification performance, particularly in settings dominated by non-mention and negated findings. Overall, the results indicate that selective fine-tuning of pretrained generative language models provides an efficient and effective pathway for clinical text classification, enabling scalable adaptation to real-world EHR data while significantly reducing computational complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This submission is a full-length research manuscript consisting of 37 pages and 15 figures.

| **[Clustering in Deep Stochastic Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21942v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across various domains but understanding the precise token dynamics remains a theoretical challenge. Existing theories of deep Transformers with layer normalization typically predict that tokens cluster to a single point; however, these results rely on deterministic weight assumptions, which fail to capture the standard initialization scheme in Transformers. In this work, we show that accounting for the intrinsic stochasticity of random initialization alters this picture. More precisely, we analyze deep Transformers where noise arises from the random initialization of value matrices. Under diffusion scaling and token-wise RMS normalization, we prove that, as the number of Transformer layers goes to infinity, the discrete token dynamics converge to an interacting-particle system on the sphere where tokens are driven by a \emph{common} matrix-valued Brownian noise. In this limit, we show that initialization noise prevents the collapse to a single cluster predicted by deterministic models. For two tokens, we prove a phase transition governed by the interaction strength and the token dimension: unlike deterministic attention flows, antipodal configurations become attracting with positive probability. Numerical experiments confirm the predicted transition, reveal that antipodal formations persist for more than two tokens, and demonstrate that suppressing the intrinsic noise degrades accuracy.</p></details> | 24 pages |

Yet, their ability to produce highly human-like text raises serious concerns about misinformation and academic integrity, making it an urgent need for reliable algorithms to detect LLM-generated content. In this paper, we start by presenting a geometric approach to demystify rewrite-based detection algorithms, revealing their underlying rationale and demonstrating their generalization ability. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel rewrite-based detection algorithm that adaptively learns the distance between the original and rewritten text. Theoretically, we demonstrate that employing an adaptively learned distance function is more effective for detection than using a fixed distance. Empirically, we conduct extensive experiments with over 100 settings, and find that our approach demonstrates superior performance over baseline algorithms in the majority of scenarios. In particular, it achieves relative improvements from 57.8\% to 80.6\% over the strongest baseline across different target LLMs (e.g., GPT, Claude, and Gemini).</p></details> | Accepted by ICLR2026 |
| **[Multi-Modular MANTA-RAY: A Modular Soft Surface Platform for Distributed Multi-Object Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21884v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manipulation surfaces control objects by actively deforming their shape rather than directly grasping them. While dense actuator arrays can generate complex deformations, they also introduce high degrees of freedom (DOF), increasing system complexity and limiting scalability. The MANTA-RAY (Manipulation with Adaptive Non-rigid Textile Actuation with Reduced Actuation densitY) platform addresses these challenges by leveraging a soft, fabric-based surface with reduced actuator density to manipulate fragile and heterogeneous objects. Previous studies focused on single-module implementations supported by four actuators, whereas the feasibility and benefits of a scalable, multi-module configuration remain unexplored. In this work, we present a distributed, modular, and scalable variant of the MANTA-RAY platform that maintains manipulation performance with a reduced actuator density. The proposed multi-module MANTA-RAY platform and control strategy employs object passing between modules and a geometric transformation driven PID controller that directly maps tilt-angle control outputs to actuator commands, eliminating the need for extensive data-driven or black-box training. We evaluate system performance in simulation across surface configurations of varying modules (3x3 and 4x4) and validate its feasibility through experiments on a physical 2x2 hardware prototype. The system successfully manipulates objects with diverse geometries, masses, and textures including fragile items such as eggs and apples as well as enabling parallel manipulation. The results demonstrate that the multi-module MANTA-RAY improves scalability and enables coordinated manipulation of multiple objects across larger areas, highlighting its potential for practical, real-world applications.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[MoHETS: Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21866v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world multivariate time series can exhibit intricate multi-scale structures, including global trends, local periodicities, and non-stationary regimes, which makes long-horizon forecasting challenging. Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.</p></details> | Under review |

We first map the landscape of digital resources, analyzing critical datasets for oracle bone, bronze, and bamboo slip scripts. The core of our analysis follows the field's methodological pipeline: from foundational visual processing (image restoration, character recognition), through contextual analysis (artifact rejoining, dating), to the advanced reasoning required for automated decipherment and human-AI collaboration. We examine the technological shift from classical computer vision to modern deep learning paradigms, including transformers and large multimodal models. Finally, we synthesize the field's core challenges -- notably data scarcity and a disconnect between current AI capabilities and the holistic nature of humanistic inquiry -- and advocate for a future research agenda focused on creating multimodal, few-shot, and human-centric systems to augment scholarly expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pos...</summary><p>A position paper in progress with Peking University & ByteDance Digital Humanities Open Lab</p></details> |
| **[A Decomposable Forward Process in Diffusion Models for Time-Series Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21812v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a model-agnostic forward diffusion process for time-series forecasting that decomposes signals into spectral components, preserving structured temporal patterns such as seasonality more effectively than standard diffusion. Unlike prior work that modifies the network architecture or diffuses directly in the frequency domain, our proposed method alters only the diffusion process itself, making it compatible with existing diffusion backbones (e.g., DiffWave, TimeGrad, CSDI). By staging noise injection according to component energy, it maintains high signal-to-noise ratios for dominant frequencies throughout the diffusion trajectory, thereby improving the recoverability of long-term patterns. This strategy enables the model to maintain the signal structure for a longer period in the forward process, leading to improved forecast quality. Across standard forecasting benchmarks, we show that applying spectral decomposition strategies, such as the Fourier or Wavelet transform, consistently improves upon diffusion models using the baseline forward process, with negligible computational overhead.

| **[Rethinking LLM Inference Bottlenecks: Insights from Latent Attention and Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15465v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational workloads composing traditional transformer models are starkly bifurcated. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Grouped-Query Attention are memory-bound due to low arithmetic intensity, while FeedForward Networks are compute-bound. This dichotomy has long motivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the attention bottleneck. This paper argues that recent architectural advances in transformer models -- Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) -- introduce new dominant bottlenecks, shifting the challenge away from memory-intensive attention. We make two key observations. First, the arithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude higher than that of MHA, moving it toward a compute-bound regime well-matched to modern accelerators such as GPUs. Second, distributing MoE experts across a pool of accelerators allows batching to tune their arithmetic intensity to that of dense layers, producing a more balanced computational profile. Consequently, the focus of hardware and system optimization should shift from attention acceleration to high-bandwidth interconnects and balancing expert workloads across accelerators.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |
| **[FreqKV: Key-Value Compression in Frequency Domain for Context Window Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00570v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing key-value (KV) cache compression methods for large language models (LLMs) often rely on token eviction, which risks losing critical local information in both long prefilling and decoding scenarios. When extrapolating beyond the pretrained context length, their performance degrades sharply on long-context benchmarks. Motivated by the observation in the frequency domain that the context information is concentrated in the low-frequency components, we propose FreqKV, a parameter-free and architecture-agnostic approach. It iteratively compresses the increasing KV cache in the frequency domain, allowing models to process lengthy contexts efficiently. With minimal training at 8K length, FreqKV extends the context window of LLaMA-2-7B up to 256K tokens while maintaining stable perplexity. Extensive experiments across prefilling and decoding demonstrate that FreqKV enables robust context window extension and consistently outperforms existing KV cache compression methods on LLaMA-2 and LLaMA-3, highlighting its effectiveness for both understanding and generation in long contexts.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Our OneMall systematically unifies the e-commerce's multiple item distribution scenarios, such as Product-card, short-video and live-streaming. Specifically, it comprises three key components, aligning the entire model training pipeline to the LLM's pre-training/post-training: (1) E-commerce Semantic Tokenizer: we provide a tokenizer solution that captures both real-world semantics and business-specific item relations across different scenarios; (2) Transformer-based Architecture: we largely utilize Transformer as our model backbone, e.g., employing Query-Former for long sequence compression, Cross-Attention for multi-behavior sequence fusion, and Sparse MoE for scalable auto-regressive generation; (3) Reinforcement Learning Pipeline: we further connect retrieval and ranking models via RL, enabling the ranking model to serve as a reward signal for end-to-end policy retrieval model optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OneMall achieves consistent improvements across all e-commerce scenarios: +13.01\% GMV in product-card, +15.32\% Orders in Short-Video, and +2.78\% Orders in Live-Streaming. OneMall has been deployed, serving over 400 million daily active users at Kuaishou.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Maintaining and modernizing these languages is challenging, especially when migrating to newer standards such as Fortran 2008. This is exacerbated in the presence of legacy proprietary extensions on such legacy languages, because their semantics are often based on old context (limits of legacy language, domain logic,...). This paper presents an approach for automatically migrating FORTRAN 77 with a proprietary extension, named Esope, to Fortran 2008. We introduce a tool that converts Esope source code to Fortran 2008. While supporting readability of the generated code, we want to maintain the level of abstraction provided by Esope. Our method uses model-driven engineering techniques, with transformations to generate a target model from which we export easy-to-read Fortran 2008 source code. We discuss the advantages, limitations, and maintainability considerations of our approach and provide insights into its scalability and adaptability to evolving requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SANER'26 Industrial track</p></details> |

However, prevalent memory preprocessing paradigms suffer from destructive de-contextualization. By compressing complex sequential dependencies into pre-defined structures (e.g., embeddings or graphs), these methods sever the contextual integrity essential for deep reasoning. To address this, we propose E-mem, a framework shifting from Memory Preprocessing to Episodic Context Reconstruction. Inspired by biological engrams, E-mem employs a heterogeneous hierarchical architecture where multiple assistant agents maintain uncompressed memory contexts, while a central master agent orchestrates global planning. Unlike passive retrieval, our mechanism empowers assistants to locally reason within activated segments, extracting context-aware evidence before aggregation. Evaluations on the LoCoMo benchmark demonstrate that E-mem achieves over 54\% F1, surpassing the state-of-the-art GAM by 7.75\%, while reducing token cost by over 70\%.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Why Attention Patterns Exist: A Unifying Temporal Perspective Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21709v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Attention patterns play a crucial role in both training and inference of large language models (LLMs). Prior works have identified individual patterns such as retrieval heads, sink heads, and diagonal traces, yet these observations remain fragmented and lack a unifying explanation. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{Temporal Attention Pattern Predictability Analysis (TAPPA), a unifying framework that explains diverse attention patterns by analyzing their underlying mathematical formulations} from a temporally continuous perspective. TAPPA both deepens the understanding of attention behavior and guides inference acceleration approaches. Specifically, TAPPA characterizes attention patterns as predictable patterns with clear regularities and unpredictable patterns that appear effectively random. Our analysis further reveals that this distinction can be explained by the degree of query self-similarity along the temporal dimension. Focusing on the predictable patterns, we further provide a detailed mathematical analysis of three representative cases through the joint effect of queries, keys, and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE). We validate TAPPA by applying its insights to KV cache compression and LLM pruning tasks. Across these tasks, a simple metric motivated by TAPPA consistently improves performance over baseline methods. The code is available at https://github.com/MIRALab-USTC/LLM-TAPPA.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[Outcome-Based RL Provably Leads Transformers to Reason, but Only With the Right Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15158v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformers trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) with outcome-based supervision can spontaneously develop the ability to generate intermediate reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought). Yet the mechanism by which sparse rewards drive policy gradient to discover such systematic reasoning remains poorly understood. We address this by analyzing the policy gradient dynamics of single-layer Transformers on a synthetic graph traversal task that cannot be solved without Chain-of-Thought but admits a simple iterative solution. We prove that despite training solely on final-answer correctness, policy gradient drives the Transformer to converge to a structured, interpretable algorithm that iteratively traverses the graph vertex-by-vertex. We characterize the distributional properties required for this emergence, identifying the critical role of "simple examples": instances requiring fewer reasoning steps. When the training distribution places sufficient mass on these simpler examples, the Transformer learns a generalizable traversal strategy that extrapolates to longer chains; when this mass vanishes, policy gradient learning becomes infeasible. We corroborate our theoretical results through experiments on synthetic data and with real-world language models on mathematical reasoning tasks, validating that our theoretical findings carry over to practical settings.</p></details> | 87 pages, 6 figures |
| **[AtPatch: Debugging Transformers via Hot-Fixing Over-Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21695v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based deep neural networks (DNNs) affected by backdoor attacks and unfairness typically exhibit anomalous attention patterns, leading to over-attend to backdoor triggers or protected attributes. Existing neuron-editing mitigation strategies often struggle to handle such situation and most of them lack flexibility and tend to distort feature representations. Motivated by such over-attention phenomenon and software engineering paradigms such as delta debugging and hot patching, we propose AtPatch, a hot-fix method that dynamically redistributes attention maps during model inference. Specifically, for a given input, AtPatch first extracts the attention map from the model's inference process. Then, it uses a pre-trained detector to identify anomalous columns and replace them with unified benign attention. Then, AtPatch rescales other columns to mitigate the impact of over-attention. Finally, AtPatch returns the redistributed attention map to the model for continued inference. Notably, if the detector does not report any anomalous columns, AtPatch directly returns the original attention map to the model. Unlike existing techniques, AtPatch selectively redistributes the attention map, making it better at preserving the model's original functionality. Furthermore, AtPatch's on-the-fly nature allows it to work without modifying model parameters or retraining, making it better suited for deployed models. We conducted extensive experiments to validate AtPatch. Experimental results show that, compared to existing methods, AtPatch can more effectively mitigate backdoor attacks and unfairness while better preserving the model's original functionality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |

Enabling end-to-end chart editing according to user intent is of great practical value, yet remains challenging due to the need for both fine-grained control and global structural consistency. Most existing approaches adopt pipeline-based designs, where natural language or code serves as an intermediate representation, limiting their ability to faithfully execute complex edits. We introduce ChartE$^{3}$, an End-to-End Chart Editing benchmark that directly evaluates models without relying on intermediate natural language programs or code-level supervision. ChartE$^{3}$ focuses on two complementary editing dimensions: local editing, which involves fine-grained appearance changes such as font or color adjustments, and global editing, which requires holistic, data-centric transformations including data filtering and trend line addition. ChartE$^{3}$ contains over 1,200 high-quality samples constructed via a well-designed data pipeline with human curation. Each sample is provided as a triplet of a chart image, its underlying code, and a multimodal editing instruction, enabling evaluation from both objective and subjective perspectives. Extensive benchmarking of state-of-the-art multimodal large language models reveals substantial performance gaps, particularly on global editing tasks, highlighting critical limitations in current end-to-end chart editing capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our b...</summary><p>Our benchmark will be publicly available at https://github.com/galactic123/ChartE3</p></details> |

However, prior approaches that scale offline RL either rely heavily on expert trajectories or struggle to generalize to diverse unseen tasks. Inspired by the excellent generalization of world model in conditional video generation, we explore the potential of image observation-based world model for scaling offline RL and enhancing generalization on novel tasks. In this paper, we introduce JOWA: Jointly-Optimized World-Action model, an offline model-based RL agent pretrained on multiple Atari games with 6 billion tokens data to learn general-purpose representation and decision-making ability. Our method jointly optimizes a world-action model through a shared transformer backbone, which stabilize temporal difference learning with large models during pretraining. Moreover, we propose a provably efficient and parallelizable planning algorithm to compensate for the Q-value estimation error and thus search out better policies. Experimental results indicate that our largest agent, with 150 million parameters, achieves 78.9% human-level performance on pretrained games using only 10% subsampled offline data, outperforming existing state-of-the-art large-scale offline RL baselines by 31.6% on averange. Furthermore, JOWA scales favorably with model capacity and can sample-efficiently transfer to novel games using only 5k offline fine-tuning data (approximately 4 trajectories) per game, demonstrating superior generalization.

The standard approach involves training a general-purpose tokenizer that uniformly processes all textual data during both training and inference. However, the use of a generic set of tokens can incur inefficiencies when applying the model to specific domains or languages. To address this limitation, we propose a post-training adaptation strategy that selectively replaces low-utility tokens with more relevant ones based on their frequency in an adaptation corpus. Our algorithm identifies the token inventory that most effectively encodes the adaptation corpus for a given target vocabulary size. Extensive experiments on generation and classification tasks across multiple languages demonstrate that our adapted tokenizers compress test corpora more effectively than baselines using the same vocabulary size. This method serves as a lightweight adaptation mechanism, akin to a vocabulary fine-tuning process, enabling optimized tokenization for specific domains or tasks. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/vijini/Adapt-BPE.git.</p></details> | EACL 2026 |

However, slow inference speeds and prevalent non-autoregressive paradigms severely constrain the application of diffusion-based THG models. In this study, we propose REST, a pioneering diffusion-based, real-time, end-to-end streaming audio-driven talking head generation framework. To support real-time end-to-end generation, a compact video latent space is first learned through a spatiotemporal variational autoencoder with a high compression ratio. Additionally, to enable semi-autoregressive streaming within the compact video latent space, we introduce an ID-Context Cache mechanism, which integrates ID-Sink and Context-Cache principles into key-value caching for maintaining identity consistency and temporal coherence during long-term streaming generation. Furthermore, an Asynchronous Streaming Distillation (ASD) strategy is proposed to mitigate error accumulation and enhance temporal consistency in streaming generation, leveraging a non-streaming teacher with an asynchronous noise schedule to supervise the streaming student. REST bridges the gap between autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches, achieving a breakthrough in efficiency for applications requiring real-time THG.

This method aims to uncover processes leading to self-organization of evolutionary and ecosystemic dynamics in CAs. We build on previous work which uses diversity search algorithms in Lenia to find self-organized individual patterns, and extend it to large environments that support distinct interacting patterns. We adapt Intrinsically Motivated Goal Exploration Processes (IMGEPs) to drive exploration of diverse Flow-Lenia environments using simulation-wide metrics, such as evolutionary activity, compression-based complexity, and multi-scale entropy. We test our method in two experiments, showcasing its ability to illuminate significantly more diverse dynamics compared to random search. We show qualitative results illustrating how ecosystemic simulations enable self-organization of complex collective behaviors not captured by previous individual pattern search and analysis. We complement automated discovery with an interactive exploration tool, creating an effective human-AI collaborative workflow for scientific investigation. Though demonstrated specifically with Flow-Lenia, this methodology provides a framework potentially applicable to other parameterizable complex systems where understanding emergent collective properties is of interest.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ALife 2025.

While complex-valued LLMs, such as iFairy, offer a superior chance for low-bit representation compared to real-valued counterparts, they require training from scratch, preventing the utilization of the vast ecosystem of pre-trained real-valued foundation models. Here we present Fairy2i, a universal framework that transforms pre-trained real-valued layers into an equivalent widely-linear complex form, enabling extremely low-bit quantization while reusing existing checkpoints. By proving a lossless mathematical equivalence between real and widely-linear maps, we convert standard Transformers into the complex domain and employ a phase-aware quantization scheme with a highly efficient codebook of fourth roots of unity. Furthermore, we introduce a recursive residual quantization mechanism that iteratively minimizes quantization error, allowing inference to proceed via efficient multiplication-free accumulation. We demonstrate that Fairy2i restores the performance of LLaMA-2 7B at an effective 2-bit precision to levels nearly comparable with full-precision baselines, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art real-valued binary and ternary quantization methods. This work bridges the gap between the representational efficiency of complex-valued arithmetic and the practical utility of pre-trained models, paving a new way for efficient inference on commodity hardware. We open-source the Fairy2i model and code at https://huggingface.co/PKU-DS-LAB/Fairy2i-W2 and https://github.com/PKULab1806/Fairy2i-W2.</p></details> | 15 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Gauge-invariant representation holonomy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21653v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep networks learn internal representations whose geometry--how features bend, rotate, and evolve--affects both generalization and robustness. Existing similarity measures such as CKA or SVCCA capture pointwise overlap between activation sets, but miss how representations change along input paths. Two models may appear nearly identical under these metrics yet respond very differently to perturbations or adversarial stress. We introduce representation holonomy, a gauge-invariant statistic that measures this path dependence. Conceptually, holonomy quantifies the "twist" accumulated when features are parallel-transported around a small loop in input space: flat representations yield zero holonomy, while nonzero values reveal hidden curvature. Our estimator fixes gauge through global whitening, aligns neighborhoods using shared subspaces and rotation-only Procrustes, and embeds the result back to the full feature space. We prove invariance to orthogonal (and affine, post-whitening) transformations, establish a linear null for affine layers, and show that holonomy vanishes at small radii. Empirically, holonomy increases with loop radius, separates models that appear similar under CKA, and correlates with adversarial and corruption robustness. It also tracks training dynamics as features form and stabilize. Together, these results position representation holonomy as a practical and scalable diagnostic for probing the geometric structure of learned representations beyond pointwise similarity.</p></details> | <details><summary>14th ...</summary><p>14th International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR)</p></details> |

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) layers are a proven solution to scaling problems in natural language processing. However, existing MoE approaches for time-series forecasting rely on token-wise routing mechanisms, which may fail to exploit the natural locality and continuity of temporal data. In this work, we introduce Seg-MoE, a sparse MoE design that routes and processes contiguous time-step segments rather than making independent expert decisions. Token segments allow each expert to model intra-segment interactions directly, naturally aligning with inherent temporal patterns. We integrate Seg-MoE layers into a time-series Transformer and evaluate it on multiple multivariate long-term forecasting benchmarks. Seg-MoE consistently achieves state-of-the-art forecasting accuracy across almost all prediction horizons, outperforming both dense Transformers and prior token-wise MoE models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm that segment-level routing is the key factor driving these gains. Our results show that aligning the MoE routing granularity with the inherent structure of time series provides a powerful, yet previously underexplored, inductive bias, opening new avenues for conditionally sparse architectures in sequential data modeling.</p></details> | Under review |

To mitigate strong inter-subject variability, recent work has emphasized manifold-based approaches operating on covariance representations. Yet dispersion scaling and orientation alignment remain largely unaddressed in existing methods. In this paper, we address both issues through congruence transforms and introduce three complementary geometry-aware models: (i) Discriminative Congruence Transform (DCT), (ii) Deep Linear DCT (DLDCT), and (iii) Deep DCT-UNet (DDCT-UNet). These models are evaluated both as pre-alignment modules for downstream classifiers and as end-to-end discriminative systems trained via cross-entropy backpropagation with a custom logistic-regression head. Across challenging motor-imagery benchmarks, the proposed framework improves transductive cross-subject accuracy by 2-3%, demonstrating the value of geometry-aware congruence learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages (Main paper - 10 pages, Appendix - 55 pages)</p></details> |

We developed a browser-based tool that allows students to train a small transformer language model entirely on their own device, making the training process visible. In a CS1 course, 162 students completed pre- and post-test explanations of why language models sometimes produce incorrect or strange output. After a brief hands-on training activity, students' explanations shifted significantly from anthropomorphic and misconceived accounts toward data- and model-based reasoning. The results suggest that enabling learners to directly observe training can support conceptual understanding of the data-driven nature of language models and model training, even within a short intervention. For K-12 AI literacy and AI education research, the study findings suggest that enabling students to train - and not only prompt - language models can shift how they think about AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, WIP, accepted to IEEE conference</p></details> |
| **[Representation-Regularized Convolutional Audio Transformer for Audio Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21612v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bootstrap-based Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has achieved remarkable progress in audio understanding. However, existing methods typically operate at a single level of granularity, limiting their ability to model the diverse temporal and spectral structures inherent in complex audio signals. Furthermore, bootstrapping representations from scratch is computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training to converge. In this work, we propose the Convolutional Audio Transformer (CAT), a unified framework designed to address these challenges. First, to capture hierarchical audio features, CAT incorporates a Multi-resolution Block that aggregates information across varying granularities. Second, to enhance training efficiency, we introduce a Representation Regularization objective. Drawing inspiration from generative modeling, this auxiliary task guides the student model by aligning its predictions with high-quality semantic representations from frozen, pre-trained external encoders. Experimental results demonstrate that CAT significantly outperforms baselines on audio understanding benchmarks. Notably, it achieves competitive performance on the AudioSet 20k dataset with 5 times faster convergence than existing methods. Codes and checkpoints will be released soon at https://github.com/realzhouchushu/CAT.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

However, their clinical applicability is often limited by performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECG foundation models. We evaluate it on a publicly available Transformer-based foundation model. Experiments across multiple ECG tasks show that our method consistently outperforms baseline fine-tuning. On the PTB-XL benchmarks, it improves macro AUROC by 0.7%-8.9% and macro AUPRC by 23.3%-77.9%, also outperforming several recent state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced architectures. Further analyses demonstrate improved training dynamics and data efficiency, with only 30% of the training data outperforming the baseline trained on the full dataset. Ablation studies highlight the importance of stochastic depth and preview linear probing. These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued development of foundation models in the ECG domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>A Tra...</summary><p>A Transformer-based model is used as an example; the proposed post-training strategy may also be applicable to CNN-based models.

Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint, accepted at ICLR 2026</p></details> |

Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency. The conversion requires just 2.3B tokens, less than 0.01% of their pre-training data</p></details> | 20 pages, 8 figures |

We present DynamicVLA, a framework for dynamic object manipulation that integrates temporal reasoning and closed-loop adaptation through three key designs: 1) a compact 0.4B VLA using a convolutional vision encoder for spatially efficient, structurally faithful encoding, enabling fast multimodal inference; 2) Continuous Inference, enabling overlapping reasoning and execution for lower latency and timely adaptation to object motion; and 3) Latent-aware Action Streaming, which bridges the perception-execution gap by enforcing temporally aligned action execution. To fill the missing foundation of dynamic manipulation data, we introduce the Dynamic Object Manipulation (DOM) benchmark, built from scratch with an auto data collection pipeline that efficiently gathers 200K synthetic episodes across 2.8K scenes and 206 objects, and enables fast collection of 2K real-world episodes without teleoperation. Extensive evaluations demonstrate remarkable improvements in response speed, perception, and generalization, positioning DynamicVLA as a unified framework for general dynamic object manipulation across embodiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://www.infinitescript.com/project/dynamic-vla/ GitHub: https://github.com/hzxie/DynamicVLA</p></details> |

We demonstrate the ability of the proposed procedures to reliably extract sparse graphical models while limiting the number of false detections, and illustrate how activation ranks can provide insight into the informational relevance of edge sets. The considered approaches are tuning-parameter-free and have complexities akin to coordinate descents.</p></details> | 23 pages, 10 figures |

Yet, how such collectives acquire functional properties -- such as joint agency or knowledge -- that transcend those of their individual components remains an open question. Here, we combine active inference and information-theoretic analyses to explore how a minimal system of interacting agents can give rise to joint agency and collective knowledge. We model flocking dynamics using multiple active inference agents, each minimizing its own free energy while coupling reciprocally with its neighbors. We show that as agents self-organize, their interactions define higher-order statistical boundaries (Markov blankets) enclosing a ``flock'' that can be treated as an emergent agent with its own sensory, active, and internal states. When exposed to external perturbations (a ``predator''), the flock exhibits faster, coordinated responses than individual agents, reflecting collective sensitivity to environmental change. Crucially, analyses of synergistic information reveal that the flock encodes information about the predator's location that is not accessible to every individual bird, demonstrating implicit collective knowledge. Together, these results show how informational coupling among active inference agents can generate new levels of autonomy and inference, providing a framework for understanding the emergence of (implicit) collective knowledge and joint agency.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, appendix</p></details> |

Diagnosing Inference Energy Consumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22076v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy is now a critical ML computing resource. While measuring energy consumption and observing trends is a valuable first step, accurately understanding and diagnosing why those differences occur is crucial for optimization. To that end, we begin by presenting a large-scale measurement study of inference time and energy across the generative AI landscape with 46 models, 7 tasks, and 1,858 different configurations on NVIDIA H100 and B200 GPUs. Our empirical findings span order-of-magnitude variations: LLM task type can lead to 25$\times$ energy differences, video generation sometimes consumes more than 100$\times$ the energy of images, and GPU utilization differences can result in 3--5$\times$ energy differences. Based on our observations, we present a framework for reasoning about the underlying mechanisms that govern time and energy consumption. The essence is that time and energy are determined by latent metrics like memory and utilization, which are in turn affected by various factors across the algorithm, software, and hardware layers. Our framework also extends directly to throughput per watt, a critical metric for power-constrained datacenters.</p></details> | <details><summary>The M...</summary><p>The ML.ENERGY Leaderboard v3.0 is open https://ml.energy/leaderboard</p></details> |

The generative AI revolution would seem to explode this assumption, given the critical role stochastic inference plays. Yet, in spite of public demand for more transparency in AI -- along with strong evidence that humans are unreliable judges -- estimates of model reliability are conventionally based on, at most, a few output responses per input item. We adapt a method, previously used to evaluate the reliability of various metrics and estimators for machine learning evaluation, to determine whether an (existing or planned) dataset has enough responses per item to assure reliable null hypothesis statistical testing. We show that, for many common metrics, collecting even 5-10 responses per item (from each model and team of human evaluators) is not sufficient. We apply our methods to several of the very few extant gold standard test sets with multiple disaggregated responses per item and show that even these datasets lack enough responses per item. We show how our methods can help AI researchers make better decisions about how to collect data for AI evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EACL Findings 2026</p></details> |

Existing efficient approaches often rely on complex additional training or external models for compression, which limits scalability and discards critical fine-grained information. In this paper, we propose VTC-R1, a new efficient reasoning paradigm that integrates vision-text compression into the reasoning process. Instead of processing lengthy textual traces, VTC-R1 renders intermediate reasoning segments into compact images, which are iteratively fed back into vision-language models as "optical memory." We construct a training dataset based on OpenR1-Math-220K achieving 3.4x token compression and fine-tune representative VLMs-Glyph and Qwen3-VL. Extensive experiments on benchmarks such as MATH500, AIME25, AMC23 and GPQA-D demonstrate that VTC-R1 consistently outperforms standard long-context reasoning. Furthermore, our approach significantly improves inference efficiency, achieving 2.7x speedup in end-to-end latency, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for reasoning-intensive applications.

Since clusters serve as their own control, the CRXO design is typically more statistically efficient than the usual parallel-arm design. CRXO trials are increasingly popular in many areas of health research where the number of available clusters is limited. Further, in trials among severely ill patients, researchers often want to assess the effect of treatments on secondary non-terminal outcomes, but frequently in these studies, there are patients who do not survive to have these measurements fully recorded. In this paper, we provide a causal inference framework and treatment effect estimation methods for addressing truncation by death in the setting of CRXO trials. We target the survivor average causal effect (SACE) estimand, a well-defined subgroup treatment effect obtained via principal stratification. We propose novel structural and standard modeling assumptions that enable estimating the SACE within a Bayesian paradigm. We evaluate the small-sample performance of our proposed Bayesian approach for estimation of the SACE in CRXO trial settings via simulation studies. We apply our methods to a previously conducted two-period cross-sectional CRXO study examining the impact of proton pump inhibitors compared to histamine-2 receptor blockers on length of hospitalization among adults requiring invasive mechanical ventilation.</p></details> | <details><summary>corre...</summary><p>corrected minor writing errors (including in abstract) and typos</p></details> |

The aim of EIP is to invert for an ensemble that is distributed according to the pushforward of a prior under a forward process. In high energy physics (HEP), this is related to a widely known problem called unfolding, which aims to reconstruct the true physics distribution of quantities, such as momentum and angle, from measurements that are distorted by detector effects. In recent applications, the EIP also arises in full waveform inversion (FWI) and inverse imaging with unknown priors. We propose non-iterative inference-time methods that construct posterior samplers based on a new class of conditional generative models, which we call ensemble inverse generative models. For the posterior modeling, these models additionally use the ensemble information contained in the observation set on top of single measurements. Unlike existing methods, our proposed methods avoid explicit and iterative use of the forward model at inference time via training across several sets of truth-observation pairs that are consistent with the same forward model, but originate from a wide range of priors. We demonstrate that this training procedure implicitly encodes the likelihood model. The use of ensemble information helps posterior inference and enables generalization to unseen priors. We benchmark the proposed method on several synthetic and real datasets in inverse imaging, HEP, and FWI. The codes are available at https://github.com/ZhengyanHuan/The-Ensemble-Inverse-Problem--Applications-and-Methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 11 figures, in peer review</p></details> |

Consequently, numerical methods like the Finite Element Method (FEM) are widely used. However, the FEM becomes computationally expensive as problem complexity and accuracy demands increase. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) improves the FEM by dynamically placing mesh elements on the domain, balancing computational speed and accuracy. Classical AMR depends on heuristics or expensive error estimators, which may lead to suboptimal performance for complex simulations. While AMR methods based on machine learning are promising, they currently only scale to simple problems. In this work, we formulate AMR as a system of collaborating, homogeneous agents that iteratively split into multiple new agents. This agent-wise perspective enables a spatial reward formulation focused on reducing the maximum mesh element error. Our approach, Adaptive Swarm Mesh Refinement++ (ASMR++), offers efficient, stable optimization and generates highly adaptive meshes at user-defined resolution at inference time. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ASMR++ outperforms heuristic approaches and learned baselines, matching the performance of expensive error-based oracle AMR strategies. ASMR additionally generalizes to different domains during inference, and produces meshes that simulate up to 2 orders of magnitude faster than uniform refinements in more demanding settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR)</p></details> |

Sampling-based strategies inject randomness but still struggle to guarantee diversity across multiple concurrent generation runs. We address this limitation by introducing STARS ($\textbf{St}$iefel-based $\textbf{A}$ctivation Steering for Diverse $\textbf{R}$ea$\textbf{S}$oning), a training-free, inference-time intervention method that transforms activation steering into an exploration engine. At each token, STARS collects the hidden activations of concurrent generation runs and optimizes multiple additive steering directions jointly on the Stiefel manifold. STARS maximizes the geometric volume of the steered activations, while the Stiefel manifold induces orthogonality of the steering interventions. This formulation explicitly promotes divergent activation vectors of concurrent generation runs, and implicitly promotes divergent generation trajectories. This manifold optimization formulation can be solved using a Riemannian gradient descent algorithm with convergence guarantees, but this algorithm is too time-consuming for real-time inference. To guarantee low latency, we further design a lightweight one-step update with an aggressive, closed-form stepsize. For test case generation and scientific discovery benchmarks, STARS consistently outperforms standard sampling methods, achieving greater diversity without sacrificing qualitative performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 2 figures.

For the temporal residual connections, we consider different orthogonal configurations, including randomly generated and fixed-structure configurations, and we study their effect on network dynamics. A thorough mathematical analysis outlines necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure stable dynamics within DeepResESN.

Among these, GPT-based molecular language models (MLM) have shown strong molecular design performance by learning chemical syntax and semantics from large-scale data. However, existing MLMs face two fundamental limitations: they inadequately capture the graph-structured nature of molecules when formulated as next-token prediction problems, and they typically lack explicit mechanisms for target-aware generation. Here, we propose SoftMol, a unified framework that co-designs molecular representation, model architecture, and search strategy for target-aware molecular generation. SoftMol introduces soft fragments, a rule-free block representation of SMILES that enables diffusion-native modeling, and develops SoftBD, the first block-diffusion molecular language model that combines local bidirectional diffusion with autoregressive generation under molecular structural constraints. To favor generated molecules with high drug-likeness and synthetic accessibility, SoftBD is trained on a carefully curated dataset named ZINC-Curated. SoftMol further integrates a gated Monte Carlo tree search to assemble fragments in a target-aware manner. Experimental results show that, compared with current state-of-the-art models, SoftMol achieves 100% chemical validity, improves binding affinity by 9.7%, yields a 2-3x increase in molecular diversity, and delivers a 6.6x speedup in inference efficiency.

MCMC proposals which utilise gradients, such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC), can better explore the parameter space of interest if the additional hyper-parameters are chosen well. The No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) is a variant of HMC which is extremely effective at selecting these hyper-parameters but is slow to run and is not suited to GPU architectures. An alternative to NUTS, Change in the Estimator of the Expected Square HMC (ChEES-HMC) was shown not only to run faster than NUTS on GPU but also sample from posteriors more efficiently. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) samplers are another sampling method which instead output weighted samples from the posterior. They are very amenable to parallelisation and therefore being run on GPUs while having additional flexibility in their choice of proposal over MCMC. We incorporate (ChEEs-HMC) as a proposal into SMC samplers and demonstrate competitive but faster performance than NUTS on a number of tasks.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |

Generative methods that drift away from the data manifold can yield sequences that fail to fold, translate poorly, or are otherwise nonfunctional. We present RNAGenScape, a property-guided manifold Langevin dynamics framework for mRNA sequence generation that operates directly on a learned manifold of real data. By performing iterative local optimization constrained to this manifold, RNAGenScape preserves biological viability, accesses reliable guidance, and avoids excursions into nonfunctional regions of the ambient sequence space. The framework integrates three components: (1) an autoencoder jointly trained with a property predictor to learn a property-organized latent manifold, (2) a denoising autoencoder that projects updates back onto the manifold, and (3) a property-guided Langevin dynamics procedure that performs optimization along the manifold. Across three real-world mRNA datasets spanning two orders of magnitude in size, RNAGenScape increases median property gain by up to 148% and success rate by up to 30% while ensuring biological viability of generated sequences, and achieves competitive inference efficiency relative to existing generative approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICML ...</summary><p>ICML 2025 Generative AI and Biology (GenBio) Workshop, Oral presentation (top 9.7%)</p></details> |

We present MindGrab, a lightweight, fully convolutional model for volumetric skull stripping across all imaging modalities. MindGrab's architecture is designed from first principles using a spectral interpretation of dilated convolutions, and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance (mean Dice score across datasets and modalities: 95.9 with SD 1.6), with up to 40-fold speedups and substantially lower memory demands compared to established methods. Its minimal footprint allows for fast, full-volume processing in resource-constrained environments, including direct in-browser execution. MindGrab is delivered via the BrainChop platform as both a simple command-line tool (pip install brainchop) and a zero-installation web application (brainchop.org).

| **[ToolWeaver: Weaving Collaborative Semantics for Scalable Tool Use in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21947v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.</p></details> | <details><summary>10pag...</summary><p>10pages, 12 figures, Accepted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

These limitations arise from their inability to ground their broad, unstructured understanding in specific environments. To address this, we present WorldLLM, a framework that enhances LLM-based world modeling by combining Bayesian inference and autonomous active exploration with reinforcement learning. WorldLLM leverages the in-context learning abilities of LLMs to guide an LLM-based world model's predictions using natural language hypotheses given in its prompt. These hypotheses are iteratively refined through a Bayesian inference framework that leverages a second LLM as the proposal distribution given collected evidence. This evidence is collected using a curiosity-driven reinforcement learning policy that explores the environment to find transitions with a low log-likelihood under our LLM-based predictive model using the current hypotheses. By alternating between refining hypotheses and collecting new evidence, our framework autonomously drives continual improvement of the predictions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldLLM in a textual game environment that requires agents to manipulate and combine objects. The framework not only enhances predictive accuracy, but also generates human-interpretable theories of environment dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This project's code can be found at https://github.com/flowersteam/WorldLLM.

Many efficient, non-parametric forms of BP have been developed, but the most popular is Gaussian Belief Propagation (GBP), a variant that assumes all distributions are locally Gaussian. GBP is widely used due to its efficiency and empirically strong performance in applications like computer vision or sensor networks - even when modelling non-Gaussian problems. In this paper, we seek to provide a theoretical guarantee for when Gaussian approximations are valid in highly non-Gaussian, sparsely-connected factor graphs performing BP (common in spatial AI). We leverage the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to prove mathematically that variables' beliefs under BP converge to a Gaussian distribution in complex, loopy factor graphs obeying our 4 key assumptions. We then confirm experimentally that variable beliefs become increasingly Gaussian after just a few BP iterations in a stereo depth estimation task.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model. The VSE is shown to be competitive against a particle filter that knows the Lorenz system model and a recently proposed data-driven state estimation method that does not know the Lorenz system model.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The article is accepted at ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Online Bayesian Experimental Design for Partially Observed Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04403v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian experimental design (BED) provides a principled framework for optimizing data collection by choosing experiments that are maximally informative about unknown parameters. However, existing methods cannot deal with the joint challenge of (a) partially observable dynamical systems, where only noisy and incomplete observations are available, and (b) fully online inference, which updates posterior distributions and selects designs sequentially in a computationally efficient manner. Under partial observability, dynamical systems are naturally modeled as state-space models (SSMs), where latent states mediate the link between parameters and data, making the likelihood -- and thus information-theoretic objectives like the expected information gain (EIG) -- intractable. We address these challenges by deriving new estimators of the EIG and its gradient that explicitly marginalize latent states, enabling scalable stochastic optimization in nonlinear SSMs. Our approach leverages nested particle filters for efficient online state-parameter inference with convergence guarantees. Applications to realistic models, such as the susceptible-infectious-recovered (SIR) and a moving source location task, show that our framework successfully handles both partial observability and online inference.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

In such settings, outcome-based supervision is sparse and delayed, often rewarding incorrect trajectories and failing to support inference-time scaling. This motivates the use of Process Reward Models (WebPRMs) for web navigation, but existing approaches remain limited: scalar WebPRMs collapse progress into coarse, weakly grounded signals, while checklist-based WebPRMs rely on brittle template matching that fails under layout or semantic changes and often mislabels superficially correct actions as successful, providing little insight or interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce WebArbiter, a reasoning-first, principle-inducing WebPRM that formulates reward modeling as text generation, producing structured justifications that conclude with a preference verdict and identify the action most conducive to task completion under the current context. Training follows a two-stage pipeline: reasoning distillation equips the model with coherent principle-guided reasoning, and reinforcement learning corrects teacher biases by directly aligning verdicts with correctness, enabling stronger generalization. To support systematic evaluation, we release WebPRMBench, a comprehensive benchmark spanning four diverse web environments with rich tasks and high-quality preference annotations. On WebPRMBench, WebArbiter-7B outperforms the strongest baseline, GPT-5, by 9.1 points. In reward-guided trajectory search on WebArena-Lite, it surpasses the best prior WebPRM by up to 7.2 points, underscoring its robustness and practical value in real-world complex web tasks.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[LEMUR: Learned Multi-Vector Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21853v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-vector representations generated by late interaction models, such as ColBERT, enable superior retrieval quality compared to single-vector representations in information retrieval applications. In multi-vector retrieval systems, both queries and documents are encoded using one embedding for each token, and similarity between queries and documents is measured by the MaxSim similarity measure. However, the improved recall of multi-vector retrieval comes at the expense of significantly increased latency. This necessitates designing efficient approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms for multi-vector search. In this work, we introduce LEMUR, a simple-yet-efficient framework for multi-vector similarity search. LEMUR consists of two consecutive problem reductions: We first formulate multi-vector similarity search as a supervised learning problem that can be solved using a one-hidden-layer neural network. Second, we reduce inference under this model to single-vector similarity search in its latent space, which enables the use of existing single-vector ANNS methods for speeding up retrieval. In addition to performance evaluation on ColBERTv2 embeddings, we evaluate LEMUR on embeddings generated by modern multi-vector text models and multi-vector visual document retrieval models. LEMUR is an order of magnitude faster than earlier multi-vector similarity search methods.</p></details> | 17 pages |

This is especially challenging in data-scarce settings. While Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in few-shot NLP tasks, they are not well-suited for time-series data and are computationally expensive for both training and inference. In this work, we propose a novel EARD framework that combines an autonomous agent and an LLM-based detection model, where the agent acts as a reliable decision-maker for \textit{early time point determination}, while the LLM serves as a powerful \textit{rumor detector}. This approach offers the first solution for few-shot EARD, necessitating only the training of a lightweight agent and allowing the LLM to remain training-free. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show our approach boosts performance across LLMs and surpasses existing EARD methods in accuracy and earliness.</p></details> | Accepted at KDD 2026 |
| **[Rethinking LLM Inference Bottlenecks: Insights from Latent Attention and Mixture-of-Experts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15465v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational workloads composing traditional transformer models are starkly bifurcated. Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Grouped-Query Attention are memory-bound due to low arithmetic intensity, while FeedForward Networks are compute-bound. This dichotomy has long motivated research into specialized hardware to mitigate the attention bottleneck. This paper argues that recent architectural advances in transformer models -- Multi-head Latent Attention (MLA) and Mixture of Experts (MoE) -- introduce new dominant bottlenecks, shifting the challenge away from memory-intensive attention. We make two key observations. First, the arithmetic intensity of MLA is over two orders of magnitude higher than that of MHA, moving it toward a compute-bound regime well-matched to modern accelerators such as GPUs. Second, distributing MoE experts across a pool of accelerators allows batching to tune their arithmetic intensity to that of dense layers, producing a more balanced computational profile. Consequently, the focus of hardware and system optimization should shift from attention acceleration to high-bandwidth interconnects and balancing expert workloads across accelerators.</p></details> | 16 pages, 14 figures |

Therefore, memory systems are developed to leverage essential historical information. Existing memory systems typically follow a pipeline of offline memory construction and update, and online retrieval. Despite the flexible online phase, the offline phase remains fixed and task-independent. In this phase, memory construction operates under a predefined workflow and fails to emphasize task relevant information. Meanwhile, memory updates are guided by generic metrics rather than task specific supervision. This leads to a misalignment between offline memory preparation and task requirements, which undermines downstream task performance. To this end, we propose an Adversarial Memory Adaptation mechanism (AMA) that aligns memory construction and update with task objectives by simulating task execution. Specifically, first, a challenger agent generates question answer pairs based on the original dialogues. The constructed memory is then used to answer these questions, simulating downstream inference. Subsequently, an evaluator agent assesses the responses and performs error analysis. Finally, an adapter agent analyzes the error cases and performs dual level updates on both the construction strategy and the content. Through this process, the memory system receives task aware supervision signals in advance during the offline phase, enhancing its adaptability to downstream tasks. AMA can be integrated into various existing memory systems, and extensive experiments on long dialogue benchmark LoCoMo demonstrate its effectiveness.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

Since their resulting models are learned over a sequence of incremental tasks, they encode rich representations and can be regarded as pre-trained bases. Building on this view, we propose a plug-in extension paradigm termed Deployment of LoRA Components (DLC) to enhance them. For each task, we use Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to inject task-specific residuals into the base model's deep layers. During inference, representations with task-specific residuals are aggregated to produce classification predictions. To mitigate interference from non-target LoRA plugins, we introduce a lightweight weighting unit. This unit learns to assign importance scores to different LoRA-tuned representations. Like downloadable content in software, DLC serves as a plug-and-play enhancement that efficiently extends the base methods. Remarkably, on the large-scale ImageNet-100, with merely 4\% of the parameters of a standard ResNet-18, our DLC model achieves a significant 8\% improvement in accuracy, demonstrating exceptional efficiency. Under a fixed memory budget, methods equipped with DLC surpass state-of-the-art expansion-based methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, the limited coverage of existing LensLibs leads to poor generalization of the trained models to unseen lenses, whose fine-tuning pipeline is also confined to the lens-descriptions-known case. In this work, we introduce OmniLens, a flexible solution to universal CAC via (i) establishing a convincing LensLib with comprehensive coverage for pre-training a robust base model, and (ii) adapting the model to any specific lens designs with unknown lens descriptions via fast LensLib-to-specific domain adaptation. To achieve these, an Evolution-based Automatic Optical Design (EAOD) pipeline is proposed to generate a rich variety of lens samples with realistic aberration behaviors. Then, we design an unsupervised regularization term for efficient domain adaptation on a few easily accessible real-captured images based on the statistical observation of dark channel priors in degradation induced by lens aberrations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the LensLib generated by EAOD effectively develops a universal CAC model with strong generalization capabilities, which can also improve the non-blind lens-specific methods by 0.35~1.81dB in PSNR. Additionally, the proposed domain adaptation method significantly improves the base model, especially in severe aberration cases (at most 2.59dB in PSNR).
