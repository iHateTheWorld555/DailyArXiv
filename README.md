| **[Tuning-free Visual Effect Transfer across Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07833v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RefVFX, a new framework that transfers complex temporal effects from a reference video onto a target video or image in a feed-forward manner. While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

| **[MHLA: Restoring Expressivity of Linear Attention via Token-Level Multi-Head](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07832v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Transformer architecture dominates many fields, its quadratic self-attention complexity hinders its use in large-scale applications. Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU/MHLA/ Project website: https://dagroup-pku.github.io/MHLA/</p></details> |
| **[Failure-Aware RL: Reliable Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning with Self-Recovery for Real-World Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07821v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training algorithms based on deep reinforcement learning can push the limits of robotic models for specific objectives, such as generalizability, accuracy, and robustness. However, Intervention-requiring Failures (IR Failures) (e.g., a robot spilling water or breaking fragile glass) during real-world exploration happen inevitably, hindering the practical deployment of such a paradigm. To tackle this, we introduce Failure-Aware Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (FARL), a new paradigm minimizing failures during real-world reinforcement learning. We create FailureBench, a benchmark that incorporates common failure scenarios requiring human intervention, and propose an algorithm that integrates a world-model-based safety critic and a recovery policy trained offline to prevent failures during online exploration. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FARL in significantly reducing IR Failures while improving performance and generalization during online reinforcement learning post-training. FARL reduces IR Failures by 73.1% while elevating performance by 11.3% on average during real-world RL post-training.

| **[Learning the Value of Value Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17714v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard decision frameworks address uncertainty about facts but assume fixed options and values. We extend the Jeffrey-Bolker framework to model refinements in values and prove a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement. In multi-agent settings, we establish that mutual refinement will characteristically transform zero-sum games into positive-sum interactions and yield Pareto-improvements in Nash bargaining. These results show that a framework of rational choice can be extended to model value refinement. By unifying epistemic and axiological refinement under a single formalism, we broaden the conceptual foundations of rational choice and illuminate the normative status of ethical deliberation.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, mathematical appendix</p></details> |
| **[CLAPS: Posterior-Aware Conformal Intervals via Last-Layer Laplace](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01384v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present CLAPS, a posterior-aware conformal regression method that pairs a Last-Layer Laplace Approximation with split-conformal calibration. From the resulting Gaussian posterior, CLAPS defines a simple two-sided posterior CDF score that aligns the conformity metric with the full predictive shape, not just a point estimate. This alignment can yield substantially narrower prediction intervals at a fixed target coverage, particularly on small to medium tabular datasets where data are scarce and uncertainty modeling is informative. We also provide a lightweight diagnostic suite that separates aleatoric and epistemic components and visualizes posterior behavior, helping practitioners assess when and why intervals shrink. Across multiple benchmarks using the same MLP backbone, CLAPS achieves nominal coverage and offers the most efficient intervals on small to medium datasets with mild heterogeneity, while remaining competitive and diagnostically transparent on large-scale heterogeneous data where Normalized-CP and CQR attain the tightest intervals.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised for clarity and correctness; improved exposition and fixed minor issues</p></details> |
| **[The Power of Iterative Filtering for Supervised Learning with (Heavy) Contamination](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20177v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by recent work on learning with distribution shift, we give a general outlier removal algorithm called iterative polynomial filtering and show a number of striking applications for supervised learning with contamination: (1) We show that any function class that can be approximated by low-degree polynomials with respect to a hypercontractive distribution can be efficiently learned under bounded contamination (also known as nasty noise). This is a surprising resolution to a longstanding gap between the complexity of agnostic learning and learning with contamination, as it was widely believed that low-degree approximators only implied tolerance to label noise. In particular, it implies the first efficient algorithm for learning halfspaces with $η$-bounded contamination up to error $2η+ε$ with respect to the Gaussian distribution. (2) For any function class that admits the (stronger) notion of sandwiching approximators, we obtain near-optimal learning guarantees even with respect to heavy additive contamination, where far more than $1/2$ of the training set may be added adversarially. Prior related work held only for regression and in a list-decodable setting. (3) We obtain the first efficient algorithms for tolerant testable learning of functions of halfspaces with respect to any fixed log-concave distribution. Even the non-tolerant case for a single halfspace in this setting had remained open. These results significantly advance our understanding of efficient supervised learning under contamination, a setting that has been much less studied than its unsupervised counterpart.</p></details> | 36 pages |
| **[ORACLE: Explaining Feature Interactions in Neural Networks with ANOVA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10825v4)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ORACLE, a framework for explaining neural networks on tabular data and scientific factorial designs. ORACLE summarizes a trained network's prediction surface with main effects and pairwise interactions by treating the network as a black-box response, discretizing the inputs onto a grid, and fitting an orthogonal factorial (ANOVA-style) surrogate -- the $L^2$ orthogonal projection of the model response onto a finite-dimensional factorial subspace. A simple centering and $μ$-rebalancing step then expresses this surrogate as main- and interaction-effect tables that remain faithful to the original model in the $L^2$ sense. The resulting grid-based interaction maps are easy to visualize, comparable across backbones, and directly aligned with classical design-of-experiments practice. On synthetic factorial benchmarks and low- to medium-dimensional tabular regression tasks, ORACLE more accurately recovers ground-truth interaction structure and hotspots than Monte Carlo SHAP-family interaction methods, as measured by ranking, localization, and cross-backbone stability. We also discuss its scope in latent image and text settings: grid-based factorial surrogates are most effective when features admit an interpretable factorial structure, making ORACLE particularly well-suited to scientific and engineering workflows that require stable DoE-style interaction summaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>v4: R...</summary><p>v4: Revised for clarity and correctness; improved exposition and fixed minor issues</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven control of hydraulic impact hammers under strict operational and control constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07813v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a data-driven methodology for the control of static hydraulic impact hammers, also known as rock breakers, which are commonly used in the mining industry. The task addressed in this work is that of controlling the rock-breaker so its end-effector reaches arbitrary target poses, which is required in normal operation to place the hammer on top of rocks that need to be fractured. The proposed approach considers several constraints, such as unobserved state variables due to limited sensing and the strict requirement of using a discrete control interface at the joint level. First, the proposed methodology addresses the problem of system identification to obtain an approximate dynamic model of the hydraulic arm. This is done via supervised learning, using only teleoperation data. The learned dynamic model is then exploited to obtain a controller capable of reaching target end-effector poses. For policy synthesis, both reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) algorithms are utilized and contrasted. As a case study, we consider the automation of a Bobcat E10 mini-excavator arm with a hydraulic impact hammer attached as end-effector. Using this machine, both the system identification and policy synthesis stages are studied in simulation and in the real world. The best RL-based policy consistently reaches target end-effector poses with position errors below 12 cm and pitch angle errors below 0.08 rad in the real world. Considering that the impact hammer has a 4 cm diameter chisel, this level of precision is sufficient for breaking rocks. Notably, this is accomplished by relying only on approximately 68 min of teleoperation data to train and 8 min to evaluate the dynamic model, and without performing any adjustments for a successful policy Sim2Real transfer. A demonstration of policy execution in the real world can be found in https://youtu.be/e-7tDhZ4ZgA.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |
| **[More Images, More Problems? A Controlled Analysis of VLM Failure Modes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07812v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, yet their proficiency in understanding and reasoning over multiple images remains largely unexplored. While existing benchmarks have initiated the evaluation of multi-image models, a comprehensive analysis of their core weaknesses and their causes is still lacking. In this work, we introduce MIMIC (Multi-Image Model Insights and Challenges), a new benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the multi-image capabilities of LVLMs. Using MIMIC, we conduct a series of diagnostic experiments that reveal pervasive issues: LVLMs often fail to aggregate information across images and struggle to track or attend to multiple concepts simultaneously. To address these failures, we propose two novel complementary remedies. On the data side, we present a procedural data-generation strategy that composes single-image annotations into rich, targeted multi-image training examples. On the optimization side, we analyze layer-wise attention patterns and derive an attention-masking scheme tailored for multi-image inputs. Experiments substantially improved cross-image aggregation, while also enhancing performance on existing multi-image benchmarks, outperforming prior state of the art across tasks. Data and code will be made available at https://github.com/anurag-198/MIMIC.</p></details> | 19 pages, 16 figures |
| **[MixtureVitae: Open Web-Scale Pretraining Dataset With High Quality Instruction and Reasoning Data Built from Permissive-First Text Sources](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25531v5)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present MixtureVitae, an open-access pretraining corpus built to minimize legal risk while providing strong downstream performance. MixtureVitae follows a permissive-first, risk-mitigated sourcing strategy that combines public-domain and permissively licensed text (e.g., CC-BY/Apache) with carefully justified low-risk additions (e.g., government works and EU TDM-eligible sources). MixtureVitae adopts a simple, single-stage pretraining recipe that integrates a large proportion of permissive synthetic instruction and reasoning data-signals typically introduced during post-training and generally scarce in permissive web corpora. We categorize all sources into a three-tier scheme that reflects varying risk levels and provide shard-level provenance metadata to enable risk-aware usage. In controlled experiments using the open-sci-ref training protocol (fixed architectures and hyperparameters; 50B and 300B token budgets across 130M-1.7B parameters), models trained on MixtureVitae consistently outperform other permissive datasets across a suite of standard benchmarks, and at the 1.7B-parameters/300B-tokens setting, they surpass FineWeb-Edu and approach DCLM late in training. Performance is particularly strong on MMLU and on math and code benchmarks: a 1.7B model pretrained on 300B MixtureVitae tokens matches or exceeds a strong 1.7B instruction-tuned baseline on GSM8K, HumanEval, and MBPP, despite using over 36 times fewer tokens (300B vs. ~11T). Supported by a thorough decontamination analysis, these results show that permissive-first data with high instruction and reasoning density, tiered by licensing and provenance-related risk, can provide a practical and risk-mitigated foundation for training capable LLMs, reducing reliance on broad web scrapes without sacrificing competitiveness.

| **[The Confidence Trap: Gender Bias and Predictive Certainty in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07806v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increased use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sensitive domains leads to growing interest in how their confidence scores correspond to fairness and bias. This study examines the alignment between LLM-predicted confidence and human-annotated bias judgments. Focusing on gender bias, the research investigates probability confidence calibration in contexts involving gendered pronoun resolution. The goal is to evaluate if calibration metrics based on predicted confidence scores effectively capture fairness-related disparities in LLMs. The results show that, among the six state-of-the-art models, Gemma-2 demonstrates the worst calibration according to the gender bias benchmark. The primary contribution of this work is a fairness-aware evaluation of LLMs' confidence calibration, offering guidance for ethical deployment. In addition, we introduce a new calibration metric, Gender-ECE, designed to measure gender disparities in resolution tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI 2026 (AISI Track), Oral.

| **[StarFlow: Generating Structured Workflow Outputs From Sketch Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21889v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Workflows are a fundamental component of automation in enterprise platforms, enabling the orchestration of tasks, data processing, and system integrations. Despite being widely used, building workflows can be complex, often requiring manual configuration through low-code platforms or visual programming tools. To simplify this process, we explore the use of generative foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), to automatically generate structured workflows from visual inputs. Translating hand-drawn sketches or computer-generated diagrams into executable workflows is challenging due to the ambiguity of free-form drawings, variations in diagram styles, and the difficulty of inferring execution logic from visual elements. To address this, we introduce StarFlow, a framework for generating structured workflow outputs from sketches using vision-language models. We curate a diverse dataset of workflow diagrams -- including synthetic, manually annotated, and real-world samples -- to enable robust training and evaluation. We finetune and benchmark multiple vision-language models, conducting a series of ablation studies to analyze the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our results show that finetuning significantly enhances structured workflow generation, outperforming large vision-language models on this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at EACL2026</p></details> |
| **[Near-Real-Time Resource Slicing for QoS Optimization in 5G O-RAN using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14343v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-Radio Access Network (O-RAN) has become an important paradigm for 5G and beyond radio access networks. This paper presents an xApp called xSlice for the Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) of 5G O-RANs. xSlice is an online learning algorithm that adaptively adjusts MAC-layer resource allocation in response to dynamic network states, including time-varying wireless channel conditions, user mobility, traffic fluctuations, and changes in user demand. To address these network dynamics, we first formulate the Quality-of-Service (QoS) optimization problem as a regret minimization problem by quantifying the QoS demands of all traffic sessions through weighting their throughput, latency, and reliability. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that utilizes an actor-critic model to combine the advantages of both value-based and policy-based updating methods. A graph convolutional network (GCN) is incorporated as a component of the DRL framework for graph embedding of RAN data, enabling xSlice to handle a dynamic number of traffic sessions. We have implemented xSlice on an O-RAN testbed with 10 smartphones and conducted extensive experiments to evaluate its performance in realistic scenarios. Experimental results show that xSlice can reduce performance regret by 67% compared to the state-of-the-art solutions.

| **[Metaphors are a Source of Cross-Domain Misalignment of Large Reasoning Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03388v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Earlier research has shown that metaphors influence human's decision making, which raises the question of whether metaphors also influence large language models (LLMs)' reasoning pathways, considering their training data contain a large number of metaphors. In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.</p></details> | 17 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Kinship Data Benchmark for Multi-hop Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07794v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly evaluated on their ability to perform multi-hop reasoning, i.e., to combine multiple pieces of information into a coherent inference. We introduce KinshipQA, a benchmark designed to probe this capability through reasoning over kinship relations. The central contribution of our work is a generative pipeline that produces, on demand, large-scale, realistic, and culture-specific genealogical data: collections of interconnected family trees that satisfy explicit marriage constraints associated with different kinship systems. This allows task difficulty, cultural assumptions, and relational depth to be systematically controlled and varied. From these genealogies, we derive textual inference tasks that require reasoning over implicit relational chains. We evaluate the resulting benchmark using six state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and closed-source models, under a uniform zero-shot protocol with deterministic decoding. Performance is measured using exact-match and set-based metrics. Our results demonstrate that KinshipQA yields a wide spread of outcomes and exposes systematic differences in multi-hop reasoning across models and cultural settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Calibration Bands for Mean Estimates within the Exponential Dispersion Family](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18896v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A statistical model is said to be calibrated if the resulting mean estimates perfectly match the true means of the underlying responses. Aiming for calibration is often not achievable in practice as one has to deal with finite samples of noisy observations. A weaker notion of calibration is auto-calibration. An auto-calibrated model satisfies that the expected value of the responses for a given mean estimate matches this estimate. Testing for autocalibration has only been considered recently in the literature and we propose a new approach based on calibration bands. Calibration bands denote a set of lower and upper bounds such that the probability that the true means lie simultaneously inside those bounds exceeds some given confidence level. Such bands were constructed by Yang-Barber (2019) for sub-Gaussian distributions. Dimitriadis et al. (2023) then introduced narrower bands for the Bernoulli distribution. We use the same idea in order to extend the construction to the entire exponential dispersion family that contains for example the binomial, Poisson, negative binomial, gamma and normal distributions. Moreover, we show that the obtained calibration bands allow us to construct various tests for calibration and auto-calibration, respectively. As the construction of the bands does not rely on asymptotic results, we emphasize that our tests can be used for any sample size.</p></details> | 42 pages |
| **[Non-Convex Portfolio Optimization via Energy-Based Models: A Comparative Analysis Using the Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library (THRML) for Index Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07792v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Portfolio optimization under cardinality constraints transforms the classical Markowitz mean-variance problem from a convex quadratic problem into an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem. This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting. We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent. The Diebold-Mariano test confirms statistical significance with p less than 0.0001 across all comparisons. These results position energy-based models as a promising paradigm for portfolio construction, bridging statistical mechanics and quantitative finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Benchmarking Small Language Models and Small Reasoning Language Models on System Log Severity Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07790v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>System logs are crucial for monitoring and diagnosing modern computing infrastructure, but their scale and complexity require reliable and efficient automated interpretation. Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Developers most often describe postponed testing, incomplete adaptation, and limited understanding of AI-generated code, suggesting that AI assistance affects both when and why technical debt emerges.

These limitations stem from a lack of granular control over historical visual context curation and the absence of visual-aware tutorial retrieval. To bridge these gaps, we introduce OS-Symphony, a holistic framework that comprises an Orchestrator coordinating two key innovations for robust automation: (1) a Reflection-Memory Agent that utilizes milestone-driven long-term memory to enable trajectory-level self-correction, effectively mitigating visual context loss in long-horizon tasks; (2) Versatile Tool Agents featuring a Multimodal Searcher that adopts a SeeAct paradigm to navigate a browser-based sandbox to synthesize live, visually aligned tutorials, thereby resolving fidelity issues in unseen scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that OS-Symphony delivers substantial performance gains across varying model scales, establishing new state-of-the-art results on three online benchmarks, notably achieving 65.84% on OSWorld.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 11 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[The Complexity of Games with Randomised Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07775v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the complexity of solving two-player infinite duration games played on a fixed finite graph, where the control of a node is not predetermined but rather assigned randomly. In classic random-turn games, control of each node is assigned randomly every time the node is visited during a play. In this work, we study two natural variants of this where control of each node is assigned only once: (i) control is assigned randomly during a play when a node is visited for the first time and does not change for the rest of the play and (ii) control is assigned a priori before the game starts for every node by independent coin tosses and then the game is played. We investigate the complexity of computing the winning probability with three kinds of objectives-reachability, parity, and energy. We show that the qualitative questions on all variants and all objectives are NL-complete. For the quantitative questions, we show that deciding whether the maximiser can win with probability at least a given threshold for every objective is PSPACE-complete under the first mechanism, and that computing the exact winning probability for every objective is sharp-P-complete under the second. To complement our hardness results for the second mechanism, we propose randomised approximation schemes that efficiently estimate the winning probability for all three objectives, assuming a bounded number of parity colours and unary-encoded weights for energy objectives, and we empirically demonstrate their fast convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages including appendices, accepted to FoSSaCS 2026</p></details> |
| **[THETA: Triangulated Hand-State Estimation for Teleoperation and Automation in Robotic Hand Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07768v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The teleoperation of robotic hands is limited by the high costs of depth cameras and sensor gloves, commonly used to estimate hand relative joint positions (XYZ). We present a novel, cost-effective approach using three webcams for triangulation-based tracking to approximate relative joint angles (theta) of human fingers. We also introduce a modified DexHand, a low-cost robotic hand from TheRobotStudio, to demonstrate THETA's real-time application. Data collection involved 40 distinct hand gestures using three 640x480p webcams arranged at 120-degree intervals, generating over 48,000 RGB images. Joint angles were manually determined by measuring midpoints of the MCP, PIP, and DIP finger joints. Captured RGB frames were processed using a DeepLabV3 segmentation model with a ResNet-50 backbone for multi-scale hand segmentation. The segmented images were then HSV-filtered and fed into THETA's architecture, consisting of a MobileNetV2-based CNN classifier optimized for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and a 9-channel input tensor encoding multi-perspective hand representations. The classification model maps segmented hand views into discrete joint angles, achieving 97.18% accuracy, 98.72% recall, F1 Score of 0.9274, and a precision of 0.8906. In real-time inference, THETA captures simultaneous frames, segments hand regions, filters them, and compiles a 9-channel tensor for classification. Joint-angle predictions are relayed via serial to an Arduino, enabling the DexHand to replicate hand movements. Future research will increase dataset diversity, integrate wrist tracking, and apply computer vision techniques such as OpenAI-Vision. THETA potentially ensures cost-effective, user-friendly teleoperation for medical, linguistic, and manufacturing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 11th International Conference on Engineering and Emerging Technologies (ICEET) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Contrastive Learning with Narrative Twins for Modeling Story Salience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07765v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding narratives requires identifying which events are most salient for a story's progression. We present a contrastive learning framework for modeling narrative salience that learns story embeddings from narrative twins: stories that share the same plot but differ in surface form. Our model is trained to distinguish a story from both its narrative twin and a distractor with similar surface features but different plot. Using the resulting embeddings, we evaluate four narratologically motivated operations for inferring salience (deletion, shifting, disruption, and summarization). Experiments on short narratives from the ROCStories corpus and longer Wikipedia plot summaries show that contrastively learned story embeddings outperform a masked-language-model baseline, and that summarization is the most reliable operation for identifying salient sentences. If narrative twins are not available, random dropout can be used to generate the twins from a single story. Effective distractors can be obtained either by prompting LLMs or, in long-form narratives, by using different parts of the same story.</p></details> | EACL 2026 |

Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN) surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio, the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on MLxOR: Mathematical Foundations and Operational Integration of Machine Learning for Uncertainty-Aware Decision-Making</p></details> |

This leads to globally suboptimal behavior, where plans are frequently revised or abandoned entirely. In the influential model of Kleinberg and Oren (2014) such behavior is modeled by a present-biased agent navigating a task graph toward a goal, making locally optimal decisions at each step based on discounted future costs. As a result, the agent may repeatedly deviate from initial plans. Recent work by Belova et al. (2024) introduced a two-agent extension of this model, where a fully-aware principal attempts to guide the present-biased agent through a specific set of critical tasks without causing abandonment. This captures a rich class of principal-agent dynamics in behavioral settings. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive algorithmic characterization of this problem. We analyze its computational complexity through the framework of parameterized algorithms, focusing on graph parameters that naturally emerge in this setting, such as treewidth, vertex cover, and feedback vertex set. Our main result is a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm when parameterized by the treewidth of the task graph and the number of distinct (v,t)-path costs. Our algorithm encaptures several input settings, such as bounded edge costs and restricted task graph structure. We demonstrate that our main result yields efficient algorithms for a number of such configurations. We complement this with tight hardness results, that highlight the extreme difficulty of the problem even on simplest graphs with bounded number of nodes and constant parameter values, and motivate our choice of parameters. We delineate tractable and intractable regions of the problem landscape, which include answers to open questions of Belova et al. (2024).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Given an image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K (zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The code will be released here.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 14 tables, Neurips 2025</p></details> |
| **[Video Evidence to Reasoning Efficient Video Understanding via Explicit Evidence Grounding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07761v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) face a fundamental dilemma in video reasoning: they are caught between the prohibitive computational costs of verbose reasoning and the hallucination risks of efficient, ungrounded approaches. To resolve this, we introduce the Chain of Evidence (CoE), a novel framework that architecturally decouples and co-optimizes perceptual grounding and reasoning efficiency. CoE incorporates two core innovations: (1) A lightweight Evidence Grounding Module (EGM) that acts as a query-guided filter, dynamically identifying and extracting a compact set of high-fidelity visual evidence; and (2) An Evidence-Anchoring Protocol optimized via Reinforcement Learning. Crucially, we design a composite reward mechanism that enforces process alignment, compelling the model to strictly reference identified temporal anchors during deduction, thereby mitigating hallucinations. To enable this, we construct CoE-Instruct, a large-scale dataset (164k samples) featuring a novel dual-annotation schema for separate perception and reasoning supervision. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks, including Video-MME, MVBench, and VSI-Bench, demonstrate that CoE-enhanced models establish a new state-of-the-art. They significantly outperform existing methods in accuracy, proving CoE to be a powerful and practical paradigm for reliable video understanding.</p></details> | 6 pages |

Yet, bin boundaries are often chosen by hand. A simple, popular choice is to apply argmax projections of multi-class scores and equidistant binning of one-dimensional discriminants. We propose a binning optimization for signal significance directly in multi-dimensional discriminants. We use a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) to define flexible bin boundary shapes for multi-class scores, while in one dimension (binary classification) we move bin boundaries directly. On this binning model, we study two optimization strategies: a differentiable and a Bayesian optimization approach. We study two toy setups: a binary classification and a three-class problem with two signals and backgrounds. In the one-dimensional case, both approaches achieve similar gains in signal sensitivity compared to equidistant binnings for a given number of bins. In the multi-dimensional case, the GMM-based binning defines sensitive categories as well, with the differentiable approach performing best. We show that, in particular for limited separability of the signal processes, our approach outperforms argmax classification even with optimized binning in the one-dimensional projections. Both methods are released as lightweight Python plugins intended for straightforward integration into existing analyses.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

However, performance can drop considerably when there is a shift in the distribution of data from training to test time. We study this phenomenon in a setting in which the training data come from multiple domains, and the test data come from a domain not seen at training that is subject to significant covariate shift. We present a new method for contrastive learning that incorporates domain labels to increase the domain invariance of learned representations, leading to improved out-of-distribution generalization. Our method adjusts the temperature parameter in the InfoNCE loss -- which controls the relative weighting of negative pairs -- using the probability that a negative sample comes from the same domain as the anchor. This upweights pairs from more similar domains, encouraging the model to discriminate samples based on domain-invariant attributes. Through experiments on a variant of the MNIST dataset, we demonstrate that our method yields better out-of-distribution performance than domain generalization baselines. Furthermore, our method maintains strong in-distribution task performance, substantially outperforming baselines on this measure.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS SSL Workshop 2023</p></details> |

While existing methods excel at prompt-based or keyframe-conditioned editing, they struggle with dynamic temporal effects such as dynamic lighting changes or character transformations, which are difficult to describe via text or static conditions. Transferring a video effect is challenging, as the model must integrate the new temporal dynamics with the input video's existing motion and appearance. % To address this, we introduce a large-scale dataset of triplets, where each triplet consists of a reference effect video, an input image or video, and a corresponding output video depicting the transferred effect. Creating this data is non-trivial, especially the video-to-video effect triplets, which do not exist naturally. To generate these, we propose a scalable automated pipeline that creates high-quality paired videos designed to preserve the input's motion and structure while transforming it based on some fixed, repeatable effect. We then augment this data with image-to-video effects derived from LoRA adapters and code-based temporal effects generated through programmatic composition. Building on our new dataset, we train our reference-conditioned model using recent text-to-video backbones. Experimental results demonstrate that RefVFX produces visually consistent and temporally coherent edits, generalizes across unseen effect categories, and outperforms prompt-only baselines in both quantitative metrics and human preference.

| **[MHLA: Restoring Expressivity of Linear Attention via Token-Level Multi-Head](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07832v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the Transformer architecture dominates many fields, its quadratic self-attention complexity hinders its use in large-scale applications. Linear attention offers an efficient alternative, but its direct application often degrades performance, with existing fixes typically re-introducing computational overhead through extra modules (e.g., depthwise separable convolution) that defeat the original purpose. In this work, we identify a key failure mode in these methods: global context collapse, where the model loses representational diversity. To address this, we propose Multi-Head Linear Attention (MHLA), which preserves this diversity by computing attention within divided heads along the token dimension. We prove that MHLA maintains linear complexity while recovering much of the expressive power of softmax attention, and verify its effectiveness across multiple domains, achieving a 3.6\% improvement on ImageNet classification, a 6.3\% gain on NLP, a 12.6\% improvement on image generation, and a 41\% enhancement on video generation under the same time complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/DAGroup-PKU/MHLA/ Project website: https://dagroup-pku.github.io/MHLA/</p></details> |

We extend the Jeffrey-Bolker framework to model refinements in values and prove a value-of-information theorem for axiological refinement. In multi-agent settings, we establish that mutual refinement will characteristically transform zero-sum games into positive-sum interactions and yield Pareto-improvements in Nash bargaining. These results show that a framework of rational choice can be extended to model value refinement. By unifying epistemic and axiological refinement under a single formalism, we broaden the conceptual foundations of rational choice and illuminate the normative status of ethical deliberation.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 6 figures, mathematical appendix</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting. We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent. The Diebold-Mariano test confirms statistical significance with p less than 0.0001 across all comparisons. These results position energy-based models as a promising paradigm for portfolio construction, bridging statistical mechanics and quantitative finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

Understanding these mechanisms' decision-making processes, or mechanistic interpretability, enables (1) accountability and control in high-stakes domains, (2) the study of digital brains and the emergence of cognition, and (3) discovery of new knowledge when AI systems outperform humans. This paper traces how attention head intervention emerged as a key method for causal interpretability of transformers. The evolution from visualization to intervention represents a paradigm shift from observing correlations to causally validating mechanistic hypotheses through direct intervention. Head intervention studies revealed robust empirical findings while also highlighting limitations that complicate interpretation. Recent work demonstrates that mechanistic understanding now enables targeted control of model behaviour, successfully suppressing toxic outputs and manipulating semantic content through selective attention head intervention, validating the practical utility of interpretability research for AI safety.</p></details> | updated abstract |

AptaFind transforms this navigation problem through a three-tier intelligence architecture that recognizes research mining is a spectrum, not a binary success or failure. The system delivers direct sequence extraction when possible, curated research leads when extraction fails, and exhaustive literature discovery for additional confidence. By combining local language models for semantic understanding with deterministic algorithms for reliability, AptaFind operates without cloud dependencies or subscription barriers. Validation across 300 University of Texas Aptamer Database targets demonstrates 84 % with some literature found, 84 % with curated research leads, and 79 % with a direct sequence extraction, at a laptop-compute rate of over 900 targets an hour.

| **[Active Evaluation of General Agents: Problem Definition and Comparison of Baseline Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07651v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As intelligent agents become more generally-capable, i.e. able to master a wide variety of tasks, the complexity and cost of properly evaluating them rises significantly. Tasks that assess specific capabilities of the agents can be correlated and stochastic, requiring many samples for accurate comparisons, leading to added costs. In this paper, we propose a formal definition and a conceptual framework for active evaluation of agents across multiple tasks, which assesses the performance of ranking algorithms as a function of number of evaluation data samples. Rather than curating, filtering, or compressing existing data sets as a preprocessing step, we propose an online framing: on every iteration, the ranking algorithm chooses the task and agents to sample scores from. Then, evaluation algorithms report a ranking of agents on each iteration and their performance is assessed with respect to the ground truth ranking over time. Several baselines are compared under different experimental contexts, with synthetic generated data and simulated online access to real evaluation data from Atari game-playing agents. We find that the classical Elo rating system -- while it suffers from well-known failure modes, in theory -- is a consistently reliable choice for efficient reduction of ranking error in practice. A recently-proposed method, Soft Condorcet Optimization, shows comparable performance to Elo on synthetic data and significantly outperforms Elo on real Atari agent evaluation. When task variation from the ground truth is high, selecting tasks based on proportional representation leads to higher rate of ranking error reduction.</p></details> | AAMAS 2026 |

This paper uses Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to develop a new approach to simulating such multivariate extreme events. Specifically, we assume that after transformation to a standard scale the distribution of the random phenomenon of interest is multivariate regular varying and use this to provide a sampling procedure for extremes on the original scale. Our procedure combines a Wasserstein-Aitchison Generative Adversarial Network (WA-GAN) to simulate the tail dependence structure on the standard scale with joint modeling of the univariate marginal tails on the original scale. The WA-GAN procedure relies on the angular measure-encoding the distribution on the unit simplex of the angles of extreme observations-after transformation to Aitchison coordinates, which allows the Wasserstein-GAN algorithm to be run in a linear space. Our method is applied both to simulated data under various tail dependence scenarios and to a financial data set from the Kenneth French Data Library. The proposed algorithm demonstrates strong performance compared to existing alternatives in the literature, both in capturing tail dependence structures and in generating accurate new extreme observations.</p></details> | 40 pages |

Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions. Building on these designs, we present an extended version, DyDiT++, with improvements in three key aspects. First, it extends the generation mechanism of DyDiT beyond diffusion to flow matching, demonstrating that our method can also accelerate flow-matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT++. Remarkably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our approach reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, yielding 1.73x realistic speedup on hardware, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet.

Existing methods either focus solely on whether an anomaly is imminent without providing precise predictions for the future anomaly, or performing predictions directly on historical data, which is easily drowned out by the normal patterns. To address the challenges in AP task, we propose RED-F, a novel framework comprised of the Reconstruction-Elimination Model (REM) and the Dual-stream Contrastive Forecasting Model (DFM). We utilize REM to construct a baseline of normal patterns from historical data, providing a foundation for subsequent predictions of anomalies. Then DFM simultaneously predicts both the constructed normal pattern and the current window, employing a contrastive forecast that transforms the difficult AP task into a simpler, more robust task of relative trajectory comparison by computing the divergence between these two predictions. To enable the forecasting model to generate a prediction not easily obscured by normal patterns, we propose a Multi-Series Prediction (MSP) training objective to enhance its sensitivity to the current window. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the superior capability of RED-F in anomaly prediction tasks. Our code is available at http://github.com/PenyChen/RED-F.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, obtaining fully annotated data for all tasks is impractical due to labeling costs. Existing methods for partially labeled MTL typically rely on predictions from unlabeled tasks, making it difficult to establish reliable task associations and potentially leading to negative transfer and suboptimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a prototype-based knowledge retrieval framework that achieves robust MTL instead of relying on predictions from unlabeled tasks. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) a task prototype embedding task-specific characteristics and quantifying task associations, and (2) a knowledge retrieval transformer that adaptively refines feature representations based on these associations. To achieve this, we introduce an association knowledge generating (AKG) loss to ensure the task prototype consistently captures task-specific characteristics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, highlighting its potential for robust multi-task learning, even when only a subset of tasks is annotated.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

While digital archives now offer unprecedented access to these materials, the ability to systematically locate, extract, and analyze illustrations at scale remains a major challenge. We present a general and scalable AI-based pipeline for large-scale visual analysis of illuminated manuscripts. The framework integrates modern deep-learning models for page-level illustration detection, illustration extraction, and multimodal description, enabling scholars to search, cluster, and study visual materials and artistic trends across entire corpora. We demonstrate the applicability of this approach on large heterogeneous collections, including the Vatican Library and richly illuminated manuscripts such as the Bible of Borso d'Este. The system reveals meaningful visual patterns and cross-manuscript relationships by embedding illustrations into a shared representation space and analyzing their similarity structure (see figure 4). By harnessing recent advances in computer vision and vision-language models, our framework enables new forms of large-scale visual scholarship in historical studies, art history, and cultural heritage making it possible to explore iconography, stylistic trends, and cultural connections in ways that were previously impractical.</p></details> | 17 pages, 5 figures |

However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides practical and actionable guidance for efficient deployment of ME2E autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17pag...</summary><p>17pages,6 figures,6 tables</p></details> |

Unlike systems requiring explicit decoding rules, MetaGlyph uses symbols like $\in$ (membership) and $\Rightarrow$ (implication) that models already understand from their training data. We test whether these symbols work as ''instruction shortcuts'' that models can interpret without additional teaching. We evaluate eight models across two dimensions relevant to practitioners: scale (3B-1T parameters) and accessibility (open-source for local deployment vs. proprietary APIs). MetaGlyph achieves 62-81% token reduction across all task types. For API-based deployments, this translates directly to cost savings; for local deployments, it reduces latency and memory pressure. Results vary by model. Gemini 2.5 Flash achieves 75% semantic equivalence between symbolic and prose instructions on selection tasks, with 49.9% membership operator fidelity. Kimi K2 reaches 98.1% fidelity for implication ($\Rightarrow$) and achieves perfect (100%) accuracy on selection tasks with symbolic prompts. GPT-5.2 Chat shows the highest membership fidelity observed (91.3%), though with variable parse success across task types. Claude Haiku 4.5 achieves 100% parse success with 26% membership fidelity. Among mid-sized models, Qwen 2.5 7B shows 62% equivalence on extraction tasks. Mid-sized open-source models (7B-12B) show near-zero operator fidelity, suggesting a U-shaped relationship where sufficient scale overcomes instruction-tuning biases.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages and 6 tables</p></details> |

This formulation compels models to learn physiological structures implicitly, resulting in data inefficiency and opacity that diverge from medical reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose BEAT-Net, a Biomimetic ECG Analysis with Tokenization framework that reformulates the problem as a language modeling task. Utilizing a QRS tokenization strategy to transform continuous signals into biologically aligned heartbeat sequences, the architecture explicitly decomposes cardiac physiology through specialized encoders that extract local beat morphology while normalizing spatial lead perspectives and modeling temporal rhythm dependencies. Evaluations across three large-scale benchmarks demonstrate that BEAT-Net matches the diagnostic accuracy of dominant convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures while substantially improving robustness. The framework exhibits exceptional data efficiency, recovering fully supervised performance using only 30 to 35 percent of annotated data. Moreover, learned attention mechanisms provide inherent interpretability by spontaneously reproducing clinical heuristics, such as Lead II prioritization for rhythm analysis, without explicit supervision. These findings indicate that integrating biological priors offers a computationally efficient and interpretable alternative to data-intensive large-scale pre-training.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures and 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Explaining Machine Learning Predictive Models through Conditional Expectation Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07313v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of complex Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) models has led to their characterization as black boxes due to the difficulty of explaining their internal decision-making processes. This lack of transparency hinders users' ability to understand, validate and trust model behavior, particularly in high-risk applications. Although explainable AI (XAI) has made significant progress, there remains a need for versatile and effective techniques to address increasingly complex models. This work introduces Multivariate Conditional Expectation (MUCE), a model-agnostic method for local explainability designed to capture prediction changes from feature interactions. MUCE extends Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) by exploring a multivariate grid of values in the neighborhood of a given observation at inference time, providing graphical explanations that illustrate the local evolution of model predictions. In addition, two quantitative indices, stability and uncertainty, summarize local behavior and assess model reliability. Uncertainty is further decomposed into uncertainty+ and uncertainty- to capture asymmetric effects that global measures may overlook. The proposed method is validated using XGBoost models trained on three datasets: two synthetic (2D and 3D) to evaluate behavior near decision boundaries, and one transformed real-world dataset to test adaptability to heterogeneous feature types. Results show that MUCE effectively captures complex local model behavior, while the stability and uncertainty indices provide meaningful insight into prediction confidence. MUCE, together with the ICE modification and the proposed indices, offers a practical contribution to local explainability, enabling both graphical and quantitative insights that enhance the interpretability of predictive models and support more trustworthy and transparent decision-making.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 15 figures.

Furthermore, emerging applications increasingly demand simultaneous mobile edge computing (MEC) and data collection (DC) capabilities within the same aerial network. However, jointly optimizing these operations in heterogeneous satellite-AAV systems presents significant challenges due to limited on-board resources and competing demands under dynamic channel conditions. In this work, we investigate a satellite-AAV-enabled joint MEC-DC system where these platforms collaborate to serve ground devices (GDs). Specifically, we formulate a joint optimization problem to minimize the average MEC end-to-end delay and AAV energy consumption while maximizing the collected data. Since the formulated optimization problem is a non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose a Q-weighted variational policy optimization-based joint AAV movement control, GD association, offloading decision, and bandwidth allocation (QAGOB) approach. Specifically, we reformulate the optimization problem as an action space-transformed Markov decision process to adapt the variable action dimensions and hybrid action space. Subsequently, QAGOB leverages the multi-modal generation capacities of diffusion models to optimize policies and can achieve better sample efficiency while controlling the diffusion costs during training. Simulation results show that QAGOB outperforms five other benchmarks, including traditional DRL and diffusion-based DRL algorithms. Furthermore, the MEC-DC joint optimization achieves significant advantages when compared to the separate optimization of MEC and DC.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 figures, accepted by IEEE TMC</p></details> |

We introduce VAR-Scaling, the first general framework for inference-time scaling in VAR, addressing the critical challenge of discrete latent spaces that prohibit continuous path search. We find that VAR scales exhibit two distinct pattern types: general patterns and specific patterns, where later-stage specific patterns conditionally optimize early-stage general patterns. To overcome the discrete latent space barrier in VQ models, we map sampling spaces to quasi-continuous feature spaces via kernel density estimation (KDE), where high-density samples approximate stable, high-quality solutions. This transformation enables effective navigation of sampling distributions. We propose a density-adaptive hybrid sampling strategy: Top-k sampling focuses on high-density regions to preserve quality near distribution modes, while Random-k sampling explores low-density areas to maintain diversity and prevent premature convergence. Consequently, VAR-Scaling optimizes sample fidelity at critical scales to enhance output quality. Experiments in class-conditional and text-to-image evaluations demonstrate significant improvements in inference process. The code is available at https://github.com/WD7ang/VAR-Scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to PRCV 2025</p></details> |

While existing training-free approaches show promise, they often rely on surface-level statistics and overlook fundamental signal properties of the text generation process. In this work, we reframe detection as a signal processing problem, introducing a novel paradigm that analyzes the sequence of token log-probabilities in the frequency domain. By systematically analyzing the signal's spectral properties using the global Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and the local Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), we find that human-written text consistently exhibits significantly higher spectral energy. This higher energy reflects the larger-amplitude fluctuations inherent in human writing compared to the suppressed dynamics of LLM-generated text. Based on this key insight, we construct SpecDetect, a detector built on a single, robust feature from the global DFT: DFT total energy. We also propose an enhanced version, SpecDetect++, which incorporates a sampling discrepancy mechanism to further boost robustness. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art model while running in nearly half the time. Our work introduces a new, efficient, and interpretable pathway for LLM-generated text detection, showing that classical signal processing techniques offer a surprisingly powerful solution to this modern challenge.</p></details> | AAAI'26 Oral |

We review the evolution of techniques from early lexicon-based and classical machine learning approaches to modern deep learning architectures and large language models, covering widely used datasets such as IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and SST-2, and models ranging from Naive Bayes and support vector machines to LSTM networks, BERT, and attention-based transformers. Beyond summarizing prior work, this survey differentiates itself by offering a comparative, challenge-driven analysis of how these modeling paradigms address domain-specific issues such as sarcasm, negation, contextual ambiguity, and domain shift, which remain open problems in existing literature. Unlike earlier reviews that focus primarily on text-only pipelines, we also synthesize recent advances in multimodal sentiment analysis that integrate textual, audio, and visual cues from movie trailers and clips. In addition, we examine emerging concerns related to interpretability, fairness, and robustness that are often underexplored in prior surveys, and we outline future research directions including zero-shot and few-shot learning, hybrid symbolic--neural models, and real-time deployment considerations. Overall, this abstract provides a domain-focused roadmap that highlights both established solutions and unresolved challenges toward building more accurate, generalizable, and explainable sentiment analysis systems for movie review data.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 Pa...</summary><p>31 Pages; 1 figure; 108 references; ongoing paper that would be submitted to suitable Wiley journal</p></details> |

SceneNAT is trained via masked modeling over fully discretized representations of both semantic and spatial attributes. By applying a masking strategy at both the attribute level and the instance level, the model can better capture intra-object and inter-object structure. To boost relational reasoning, SceneNAT employs a dedicated triplet predictor for modeling the scene's layout and object relationships by mapping a set of learnable relation queries to a sparse set of symbolic triplets (subject, predicate, object). Extensive experiments on the 3D-FRONT dataset demonstrate that SceneNAT achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art autoregressive and diffusion baselines in both semantic compliance and spatial arrangement accuracy, while operating with substantially lower computational cost.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

Model pruning addresses this by removing redundant components from models. In particular, block pruning can achieve significant compression and inference acceleration. However, existing block pruning methods are often unstable and struggle to attain globally optimal solutions. In this paper, we propose a mutual information based pruning method MI-PRUN for LLMs. Specifically, we leverages mutual information to identify redundant blocks by evaluating transitions in hidden states. Additionally, we incorporate the Data Processing Inequality (DPI) to reveal the relationship between the importance of entire contiguous blocks and that of individual blocks. Moreover, we develop the Fast-Block-Select algorithm, which iteratively updates block combinations to achieve a globally optimal solution while significantly improving the efficiency. Extensive experiments across various models and datasets demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of our method.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Despite being widely used, building workflows can be complex, often requiring manual configuration through low-code platforms or visual programming tools. To simplify this process, we explore the use of generative foundation models, particularly vision-language models (VLMs), to automatically generate structured workflows from visual inputs. Translating hand-drawn sketches or computer-generated diagrams into executable workflows is challenging due to the ambiguity of free-form drawings, variations in diagram styles, and the difficulty of inferring execution logic from visual elements. To address this, we introduce StarFlow, a framework for generating structured workflow outputs from sketches using vision-language models. We curate a diverse dataset of workflow diagrams -- including synthetic, manually annotated, and real-world samples -- to enable robust training and evaluation. We finetune and benchmark multiple vision-language models, conducting a series of ablation studies to analyze the strengths and limitations of our approach. Our results show that finetuning significantly enhances structured workflow generation, outperforming large vision-language models on this task.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at EACL2026</p></details> |

We introduce KinshipQA, a benchmark designed to probe this capability through reasoning over kinship relations. The central contribution of our work is a generative pipeline that produces, on demand, large-scale, realistic, and culture-specific genealogical data: collections of interconnected family trees that satisfy explicit marriage constraints associated with different kinship systems. This allows task difficulty, cultural assumptions, and relational depth to be systematically controlled and varied. From these genealogies, we derive textual inference tasks that require reasoning over implicit relational chains. We evaluate the resulting benchmark using six state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning both open-source and closed-source models, under a uniform zero-shot protocol with deterministic decoding. Performance is measured using exact-match and set-based metrics. Our results demonstrate that KinshipQA yields a wide spread of outcomes and exposes systematic differences in multi-hop reasoning across models and cultural settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

This paper introduces a novel approach using THRML (Thermodynamic HypergRaphical Model Library), a JAX-based library for building and sampling probabilistic graphical models that reformulates index tracking as probabilistic inference on an Ising Hamiltonian. Unlike traditional methods that seek a single optimal solution, THRML samples from the Boltzmann distribution of high-quality portfolios using GPU-accelerated block Gibbs sampling, providing natural regularization against overfitting. We implement three key innovations: (1) dynamic coupling strength that scales inversely with market volatility (VIX), adapting diversification pressure to market regimes; (2) rebalanced bias weights prioritizing tracking quality over momentum for index replication; and (3) sector-aware post-processing ensuring institutional-grade diversification. Backtesting on a 100-stock S and P 500 universe from 2023 to 2025 demonstrates that THRML achieves 4.31 percent annualized tracking error versus 5.66 to 6.30 percent for baselines, while simultaneously generating 128.63 percent total return against the index total return of 79.61 percent. The Diebold-Mariano test confirms statistical significance with p less than 0.0001 across all comparisons. These results position energy-based models as a promising paradigm for portfolio construction, bridging statistical mechanics and quantitative finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

Since severity levels are predefined metadata in system log messages, having a model merely classify them offers limited standalone practical value, revealing little about its underlying ability to interpret system logs. We argue that severity classification is more informative when treated as a benchmark for probing runtime log comprehension rather than as an end task. Using real-world journalctl data from Linux production servers, we evaluate nine small language models (SLMs) and small reasoning language models (SRLMs) under zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) prompting. The results reveal strong stratification. Qwen3-4B achieves the highest accuracy at 95.64% with RAG, while Gemma3-1B improves from 20.25% under few-shot prompting to 85.28% with RAG. Notably, the tiny Qwen3-0.6B reaches 88.12% accuracy despite weak performance without retrieval. In contrast, several SRLMs, including Qwen3-1.7B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, degrade substantially when paired with RAG. Efficiency measurements further separate models: most Gemma and Llama variants complete inference in under 1.2 seconds per log, whereas Phi-4-Mini-Reasoning exceeds 228 seconds per log while achieving <10% accuracy. These findings suggest that (1) architectural design, (2) training objectives, and (3) the ability to integrate retrieved context under strict output constraints jointly determine performance. By emphasizing small, deployable models, this benchmark aligns with real-time requirements of digital twin (DT) systems and shows that severity classification serves as a lens for evaluating model competence and real-time deployability, with implications for root cause analysis (RCA) and broader DT integration.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In classic random-turn games, control of each node is assigned randomly every time the node is visited during a play. In this work, we study two natural variants of this where control of each node is assigned only once: (i) control is assigned randomly during a play when a node is visited for the first time and does not change for the rest of the play and (ii) control is assigned a priori before the game starts for every node by independent coin tosses and then the game is played. We investigate the complexity of computing the winning probability with three kinds of objectives-reachability, parity, and energy. We show that the qualitative questions on all variants and all objectives are NL-complete. For the quantitative questions, we show that deciding whether the maximiser can win with probability at least a given threshold for every objective is PSPACE-complete under the first mechanism, and that computing the exact winning probability for every objective is sharp-P-complete under the second. To complement our hardness results for the second mechanism, we propose randomised approximation schemes that efficiently estimate the winning probability for all three objectives, assuming a bounded number of parity colours and unary-encoded weights for energy objectives, and we empirically demonstrate their fast convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages including appendices, accepted to FoSSaCS 2026</p></details> |

We present a novel, cost-effective approach using three webcams for triangulation-based tracking to approximate relative joint angles (theta) of human fingers. We also introduce a modified DexHand, a low-cost robotic hand from TheRobotStudio, to demonstrate THETA's real-time application. Data collection involved 40 distinct hand gestures using three 640x480p webcams arranged at 120-degree intervals, generating over 48,000 RGB images. Joint angles were manually determined by measuring midpoints of the MCP, PIP, and DIP finger joints. Captured RGB frames were processed using a DeepLabV3 segmentation model with a ResNet-50 backbone for multi-scale hand segmentation. The segmented images were then HSV-filtered and fed into THETA's architecture, consisting of a MobileNetV2-based CNN classifier optimized for hierarchical spatial feature extraction and a 9-channel input tensor encoding multi-perspective hand representations. The classification model maps segmented hand views into discrete joint angles, achieving 97.18% accuracy, 98.72% recall, F1 Score of 0.9274, and a precision of 0.8906. In real-time inference, THETA captures simultaneous frames, segments hand regions, filters them, and compiles a 9-channel tensor for classification. Joint-angle predictions are relayed via serial to an Arduino, enabling the DexHand to replicate hand movements. Future research will increase dataset diversity, integrate wrist tracking, and apply computer vision techniques such as OpenAI-Vision. THETA potentially ensures cost-effective, user-friendly teleoperation for medical, linguistic, and manufacturing applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 1...</summary><p>The 11th International Conference on Engineering and Emerging Technologies (ICEET) 2025</p></details> |

We present a contrastive learning framework for modeling narrative salience that learns story embeddings from narrative twins: stories that share the same plot but differ in surface form. Our model is trained to distinguish a story from both its narrative twin and a distractor with similar surface features but different plot. Using the resulting embeddings, we evaluate four narratologically motivated operations for inferring salience (deletion, shifting, disruption, and summarization). Experiments on short narratives from the ROCStories corpus and longer Wikipedia plot summaries show that contrastively learned story embeddings outperform a masked-language-model baseline, and that summarization is the most reliable operation for identifying salient sentences. If narrative twins are not available, random dropout can be used to generate the twins from a single story. Effective distractors can be obtained either by prompting LLMs or, in long-form narratives, by using different parts of the same story.</p></details> | EACL 2026 |

Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN) surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio, the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on MLxOR: Mathematical Foundations and Operational Integration of Machine Learning for Uncertainty-Aware Decision-Making</p></details> |

We provide a reassessment of EI, including a new formalization of identification conditions and a demonstration of how these conditions fail to hold in common cases. The identification conditions reveal that, similar to causal inference, credible ecological inference requires controlling for confounders. The aggregation process itself creates additional structure to assist in estimation by restricting the conditional expectation function to be linear in the predictor variable. A linear model perspective also clarifies the differences between the EI methods commonly used in the literature, and when they lead to ecological fallacies. We provide an overview of new methodology which builds on both the identification and linearity results to flexibly control for confounders and yield improved ecological inferences. Finally, using datasets for common EI problems in which the ground truth is fortuitously observed, we show that, while covariates can help, all methods are prone to overestimating both racial polarization and nationalized partisan voting.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[Adaptive Layer Selection for Layer-Wise Token Pruning in LLM Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07667v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the prevalence of large language models (LLMs), key-value (KV) cache reduction for LLM inference has received remarkable attention. Among numerous works that have been proposed in recent years, layer-wise token pruning approaches, which select a subset of tokens at particular layers to retain in KV cache and prune others, are one of the most popular schemes. They primarily adopt a set of pre-defined layers, at which tokens are selected. Such design is inflexible in the sense that the accuracy significantly varies across tasks and deteriorates in harder tasks such as KV retrieval. In this paper, we propose ASL, a training-free method that adaptively chooses the selection layer for KV cache reduction, exploiting the variance of token ranks ordered by attention score. The proposed method balances the performance across different tasks while meeting the user-specified KV budget requirement. ASL operates during the prefilling stage and can be jointly used with existing KV cache reduction methods such as SnapKV to optimize the decoding stage. By evaluations on the InfiniteBench, RULER, and NIAH benchmarks, we show that equipped with one-shot token selection, where tokens are selected at a layer and propagated to deeper layers, ASL outperforms state-of-the-art layer-wise token selection methods in accuracy while maintaining decoding speed and KV cache reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code is available at https://github.com/TANIGUCHIREI/ASL</p></details> |

To address this limitation, we propose GP-GS, a Gaussian Process (GP) based densification framework for 3DGS optimisation. GP-GS formulates point cloud densification as a continuous regression problem, where a GP learns a local mapping from 2D pixel coordinates to 3D position and colour attributes. An adaptive neighbourhood-based sampling strategy generates candidate pixels for inference, while GP-predicted uncertainty is used to filter unreliable predictions, reducing noise and preserving geometric structure. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GP-GS consistently improves reconstruction quality and rendering fidelity, achieving up to 1.12 dB PSNR improvement over strong baselines.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

However, traditional Thromboelastography (TEG), a widely employed diagnostic modality, can only provide such outputs after nearly 1 hour of measurement. The delay might lead to elevated mortality rates. These issues clearly point out one of the key challenges for medical AI development: Mak-ing reasonable predictions based on very small data sets and accounting for variation between different patient populations, a task where conventional deep learning methods typically perform poorly. We present Physiological State Reconstruc-tion (PSR), a new algorithm specifically designed to take ad-vantage of dynamic changes between individuals and to max-imize useful information produced by small amounts of clini-cal data through mapping to reliable predictions and diagnosis. We develop MDFE to facilitate integration of varied temporal signals using multi-domain learning, and jointly learn high-level temporal interactions together with attentions via HLA; furthermore, the parameterized DAM we designed maintains the stability of the computed vital signs. PSR evaluates with 4 TEG-specialized data sets and establishes remarkable perfor-mance -- predictions of R2 > 0.98 for coagulation traits and error reduction around half compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and halving the inferencing time too. Drift-aware learning suggests a new future, with potential uses well be-yond thrombophilia discovery towards medical AI applica-tions with data scarcity.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by AAAI26</p></details> |

Unlike the traditional avatar method, which requires a studio-level multi-view capture system and reconstructs a human-specific model through a long-time optimization process, we rethink the task through the lenses of model representation, network design, and data preparation. First, we introduce a UV-guided avatar modeling strategy, in which each input image is associated with a pixel-wise facial correspondence estimation. Such correspondence estimation allows us to reproject each valid pixel color from screen space to UV space, which is independent of camera pose and character expression. Furthermore, we design learnable UV tokens on which the attention mechanism can be applied at both the screen and UV levels. The learned UV tokens can be decoded into canonical Gaussian attributes using aggregated UV information from all input views. To train our large avatar model, we additionally prepare a large-scale, identity-rich synthetic training dataset. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both monocular and multi-view settings.

Existing paradigms rely on restrictive assumptions or effortful human priors, limiting practicality, efficiency, and adaptability. Recent foundation models (FMs) offer great potential to bridge this gap. This paper investigates a critical research problem: What system architecture can effectively integrate FM knowledge for this task? We answer it with FlyCo, a principled FM-empowered perception-prediction-planning loop enabling fully autonomous, prompt-driven 3D target scanning in diverse unknown open-world environments. FlyCo directly translates low-effort human prompts (text, visual annotations) into precise adaptive scanning flights via three coordinated stages: (1) perception fuses streaming sensor data with vision-language FMs for robust target grounding and tracking; (2) prediction distills FM knowledge and combines multi-modal cues to infer the partially observed target's complete geometry; (3) planning leverages predictive foresight to generate efficient and safe paths with comprehensive target coverage. Building on this, we further design key components to boost open-world target grounding efficiency and robustness, enhance prediction quality in terms of shape accuracy, zero-shot generalization, and temporal stability, and balance long-horizon flight efficiency with real-time computability and online collision avoidance. Extensive challenging real-world and simulation experiments show FlyCo delivers precise scene understanding, high efficiency, and real-time safety, outperforming existing paradigms with lower human effort and verifying the proposed architecture's practicality.

| **[ViewMorpher3D: A 3D-aware Diffusion Framework for Multi-Camera Novel View Synthesis in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07540v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous driving systems rely heavily on multi-view images to ensure accurate perception and robust decision-making. To effectively develop and evaluate perception stacks and planning algorithms, realistic closed-loop simulators are indispensable. While 3D reconstruction techniques such as Gaussian Splatting offer promising avenues for simulator construction, the rendered novel views often exhibit artifacts, particularly in extrapolated perspectives or when available observations are sparse. We introduce ViewMorpher3D, a multi-view image enhancement framework based on image diffusion models, designed to elevate photorealism and multi-view coherence in driving scenes. Unlike single-view approaches, ViewMorpher3D jointly processes a set of rendered views conditioned on camera poses, 3D geometric priors, and temporally adjacent or spatially overlapping reference views. This enables the model to infer missing details, suppress rendering artifacts, and enforce cross-view consistency. Our framework accommodates variable numbers of cameras and flexible reference/target view configurations, making it adaptable to diverse sensor setups. Experiments on real-world driving datasets demonstrate substantial improvements in image quality metrics, effectively reducing artifacts while preserving geometric fidelity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper and supplementary materials</p></details> |
| **[DyDiT++: Diffusion Transformers with Timestep and Spatial Dynamics for Efficient Visual Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06803v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Transformer (DiT), an emerging diffusion model for visual generation, has demonstrated superior performance but suffers from substantial computational costs. Our investigations reveal that these costs primarily stem from the static inference paradigm, which inevitably introduces redundant computation in certain diffusion timesteps and spatial regions. To overcome this inefficiency, we propose Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (DyDiT), an architecture that dynamically adjusts its computation along both timestep and spatial dimensions. Building on these designs, we present an extended version, DyDiT++, with improvements in three key aspects. First, it extends the generation mechanism of DyDiT beyond diffusion to flow matching, demonstrating that our method can also accelerate flow-matching-based generation, enhancing its versatility. Furthermore, we enhance DyDiT to tackle more complex visual generation tasks, including video generation and text-to-image generation, thereby broadening its real-world applications. Finally, to address the high cost of full fine-tuning and democratize technology access, we investigate the feasibility of training DyDiT in a parameter-efficient manner and introduce timestep-based dynamic LoRA (TD-LoRA). Extensive experiments on diverse visual generation models, including DiT, SiT, Latte, and FLUX, demonstrate the effectiveness of DyDiT++. Remarkably, with <3% additional fine-tuning iterations, our approach reduces the FLOPs of DiT-XL by 51%, yielding 1.73x realistic speedup on hardware, and achieves a competitive FID score of 2.07 on ImageNet. The code is available at https://github.com/alibaba-damo-academy/DyDiT.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI) on January 9, 2026. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2410.03456</p></details> |
| **[Learning Design-Score Manifold to Guide Diffusion Models for Offline Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05680v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing complex systems, from discovering therapeutic drugs to designing high-performance materials, remains a fundamental challenge across science and engineering, as the underlying rules are often unknown and costly to evaluate. Offline optimization aims to optimize designs for target scores using pre-collected datasets without system interaction. However, conventional approaches may fail beyond training data, predicting inaccurate scores and generating inferior designs. This paper introduces ManGO, a diffusion-based framework that learns the design-score manifold, capturing the design-score interdependencies holistically. Unlike existing methods that treat design and score spaces in isolation, ManGO unifies forward prediction and backward generation, attaining generalization beyond training data. Key to this is its derivative-free guidance for conditional generation, coupled with adaptive inference-time scaling that dynamically optimizes denoising paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that ManGO outperforms 24 single- and 10 multi-objective optimization methods across diverse domains, including synthetic tasks, robot control, material design, DNA sequence, and real-world engineering optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was accepted by npj AI</p></details> |
| **[Graph Inference Towards ICD Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07496v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated ICD coding involves assigning standardized diagnostic codes to clinical narratives. The vast label space and extreme class imbalance continue to challenge precise prediction. To address these issues, LabGraph is introduced -- a unified framework that reformulates ICD coding as a graph generation task. By combining adversarial domain adaptation, graph-based reinforcement learning, and perturbation regularization, LabGraph effectively enhances model robustness and generalization. In addition, a label graph discriminator dynamically evaluates each generated code, providing adaptive reward feedback during training. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that LabGraph consistently outperforms previous approaches on micro-F1, micro-AUC, and P@K.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In response, do-SHAP employs interventional queries, but its reliance on estimands hinders its practical application. To address this problem, we propose the use of estimand-agnostic approaches, which allow for the estimation of any identifiable query from a single model, making do-SHAP feasible on complex graphs. We also develop a novel algorithm to significantly accelerate its computation at a negligible cost, as well as a method to explain inaccessible Data Generating Processes. We demonstrate the estimation and computational performance of our approach, and validate it on two real-world datasets, highlighting its potential in obtaining reliable explanations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Membership Inference Attacks on Tokenizers of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05699v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Membership inference attacks (MIAs) are widely used to assess the privacy risks associated with machine learning models. However, when these attacks are applied to pre-trained large language models (LLMs), they encounter significant challenges, including mislabeled samples, distribution shifts, and discrepancies in model size between experimental and real-world settings. To address these limitations, we introduce tokenizers as a new attack vector for membership inference. Specifically, a tokenizer converts raw text into tokens for LLMs. Unlike full models, tokenizers can be efficiently trained from scratch, thereby avoiding the aforementioned challenges. In addition, the tokenizer's training data is typically representative of the data used to pre-train LLMs. Despite these advantages, the potential of tokenizers as an attack vector remains unexplored. To this end, we present the first study on membership leakage through tokenizers and explore five attack methods to infer dataset membership. Extensive experiments on millions of Internet samples reveal the vulnerabilities in the tokenizers of state-of-the-art LLMs. To mitigate this emerging risk, we further propose an adaptive defense. Our findings highlight tokenizers as an overlooked yet critical privacy threat, underscoring the urgent need for privacy-preserving mechanisms specifically designed for them.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at USENIX Security Symposium 2026</p></details> |
| **[Lightweight Neural Framework for Robust 3D Volume and Surface Estimation from Multi-View Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11164v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate estimation of object volume and surface area from visual data is an open challenge with broad implications across various domains. We propose a unified framework that predicts volumetric and surface metrics directly from a set of 2D multi-view images. Our approach first generates a point cloud from the captured multi-view images using recent 3D reconstruction techniques, while a parallel 2D encoder aggregates view-aligned features. A fusion module then aligns and merges 3D geometry with 2D visual embeddings, followed by a graph-based decoder that regresses volume, surface area, and their corresponding uncertainties. This proposed architecture maintains robustness against sparse or noisy data. We evaluate the framework across multiple application domains: corals, where precise geometric measurements support growth monitoring; food items, where volume prediction relates to dietary tracking and portion analysis; and human bodies, where volumetric cues are crucial for anthropometric and medical applications. Experimental results demonstrate the reliable performance of our framework across diverse scenarios, highlighting its versatility and adaptability. Furthermore, by coupling 3D reconstruction with neural regression and 2D features, our model provides a scalable and fast solution for quantitative shape analysis from visual data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Expan...</summary><p>Expanded version of prior work on coral volume/surface estimation, with a generalized framework and additional evaluations across multiple domains</p></details> |
| **[Robust and Efficient Zeroth-Order LLM Fine-Tuning via Adaptive Bayesian Subspace Optimizer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01452v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with zeroth-order (ZO) optimization reduces memory by approximating gradients through function evaluations. However, existing methods essentially perform updates in a one-dimensional space, and suffer from collapse or substantial performance degradation under low-precision training. We introduce BSZO, an adaptive \textbf{B}ayesian \textbf{S}ubspace \textbf{Z}eroth-Order \textbf{O}ptimizer, which applies Kalman filtering to combine finite-difference information across multiple perturbation directions within a subspace. By treating each finite-difference measurement as a noisy observation, BSZO builds a posterior distribution over the subspace-projected gradient and updates it through Bayesian inference, with a residual-based adaptive mechanism to adapt to noise variations. Theoretical analysis shows that BSZO improves the convergence rate by a factor of $k/γ$ compared to standard ZO methods. Experiments on RoBERTa, Mistral, and OPT models show that BSZO outperforms the baselines across various tasks, achieving up to 6.67\% absolute average improvement on OPT-13B while remaining robust under fp16/bf16 precision and keeping memory usage close to inference-only baselines (1.00$\times$--1.08$\times$ of MeZO).</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Software-Hardware Co-optimization for Modular E2E AV Paradigm: A Unified Framework of Optimization Approaches, Simulation Environment and Evaluation Metrics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07393v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modular end-to-end (ME2E) autonomous driving paradigms combine modular interpretability with global optimization capability and have demonstrated strong performance. However, existing studies mainly focus on accuracy improvement, while critical system-level factors such as inference latency and energy consumption are often overlooked, resulting in increasingly complex model designs that hinder practical deployment. Prior efforts on model compression and acceleration typically optimize either the software or hardware side in isolation. Software-only optimization cannot fundamentally remove intermediate tensor access and operator scheduling overheads, whereas hardware-only optimization is constrained by model structure and precision. As a result, the real-world benefits of such optimizations are often limited. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a reusable software and hardware co-optimization and closed-loop evaluation framework for ME2E autonomous driving inference. The framework jointly integrates software-level model optimization with hardware-level computation optimization under a unified system-level objective. In addition, a multidimensional evaluation metric is introduced to assess system performance by jointly considering safety, comfort, efficiency, latency, and energy, enabling quantitative comparison of different optimization strategies. Experiments across multiple ME2E autonomous driving stacks show that the proposed framework preserves baseline-level driving performance while significantly reducing inference latency and energy consumption, achieving substantial overall system-level improvements. These results demonstrate that the proposed framework provides practical and actionable guidance for efficient deployment of ME2E autonomous driving systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>17pag...</summary><p>17pages,6 figures,6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Model-X Change-Point Detection of Conditional Distribution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12023v3)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dynamic nature of many real-world systems can lead to temporal outcome model shifts, causing a deterioration in model accuracy and reliability over time. This requires change-point detection on the outcome models to guide model retraining and adjustments. However, inferring the change point of conditional models is more prone to loss of validity or power than classic detection problems for marginal distributions. This is due to both the temporal covariate shift and the complexity of the outcome model. Also, the existing method of conditional change points detection both have many limitations including linear assumption and low dimension prerequisite which sometimes is not suitable for real world application. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Model-X changE-point detectioN of conditional Distribution (MEND) method computationally enhanced with distillation function for simultaneous change-point detection and localization of the conditional outcome model. We extend and combine our model with neural network to accommodate complex nonlinear and high dimensional situation, which is proved to be valid in both simulation and real data. Theoretical validity of the proposed method is justified. Extensive simulation studies and two real-world examples demonstrate the statistical effectiveness and computational scalability of our method as well as its significant improvements over existing methods.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[CompNO: A Novel Foundation Model approach for solving Partial Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07384v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) govern a wide range of physical phenomena, but their numerical solution remains computationally demanding, especially when repeated simulations are required across many parameter settings. Recent Scientific Foundation Models (SFMs) aim to alleviate this cost by learning universal surrogates from large collections of simulated systems, yet they typically rely on monolithic architectures with limited interpretability and high pretraining expense. In this work we introduce Compositional Neural Operators (CompNO), a compositional neural operator framework for parametric PDEs. Instead of pretraining a single large model on heterogeneous data, CompNO first learns a library of Foundation Blocks, where each block is a parametric Fourier neural operator specialized to a fundamental differential operator (e.g. convection, diffusion, nonlinear convection). These blocks are then assembled, via lightweight Adaptation Blocks, into task-specific solvers that approximate the temporal evolution operator for target PDEs. A dedicated boundary-condition operator further enforces Dirichlet constraints exactly at inference time. We validate CompNO on one-dimensional convection, diffusion, convection--diffusion and Burgers' equations from the PDEBench suite. The proposed framework achieves lower relative L2 error than strong baselines (PFNO, PDEFormer and in-context learning based models) on linear parametric systems, while remaining competitive on nonlinear Burgers' flows. The model maintains exact boundary satisfaction with zero loss at domain boundaries, and exhibits robust generalization across a broad range of Peclet and Reynolds numbers. These results demonstrate that compositional neural operators provide a scalable and physically interpretable pathway towards foundation models for PDEs.</p></details> | Under review at MDPI |

This imbalance, rooted in logic and the theory of recursive modelling frameworks, cannot be solved directly. We propose a computational framework called $\aleph$-IPOMDP, which augments the Bayesian inference of model-based RL agents with an anomaly detection algorithm and an out-of-belief policy. Our mechanism allows agents to realize that they are being deceived, even if they cannot understand how, and to deter opponents via a credible threat. We test this framework in both a mixed-motive and a zero-sum game. Our results demonstrate the $\aleph$-mechanism's effectiveness, leading to more equitable outcomes and less exploitation by more sophisticated agents. We discuss implications for AI safety, cybersecurity, cognitive science, and psychiatry.</p></details> | 28 pages, 12 figures |
| **[BayesRAG: Probabilistic Mutual Evidence Corroboration for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07329v1)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a pivotal paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), yet current approaches struggle with visually rich documents by treating text and images as isolated retrieval targets. Existing methods relying solely on cosine similarity often fail to capture the semantic reinforcement provided by cross-modal alignment and layout-induced coherence. To address these limitations, we propose BayesRAG, a novel multimodal retrieval framework grounded in Bayesian inference and Dempster-Shafer evidence theory. Unlike traditional approaches that rank candidates strictly by similarity, BayesRAG models the intrinsic consistency of retrieved candidates across modalities as probabilistic evidence to refine retrieval confidence. Specifically, our method computes the posterior association probability for combinations of multimodal retrieval results, prioritizing text-image pairs that mutually corroborate each other in terms of both semantics and layout. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BayesRAG significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on challenging multimodal benchmarks. This study establishes a new paradigm for multimodal retrieval fusion that effectively resolves the isolation of heterogeneous modalities through an evidence fusion mechanism and enhances the robustness of retrieval outcomes. Our code is available at https://github.com/TioeAre/BayesRAG.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

Numerical experiments demonstrate that this approach achieves theoretical contamination rates while remaining computationally feasible, providing the first practical implementation of $ρ$-posterior inference with rigorous finite-sample guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>53 pa...</summary><p>53 pages including the proofs in appendices, 16 figures</p></details> |
