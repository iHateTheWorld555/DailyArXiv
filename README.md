| **[Biases in the Blind Spot: Detecting What LLMs Fail to Mention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10117v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often provide chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning traces that appear plausible, but may hide internal biases. We call these *unverbalized biases*. Monitoring models via their stated reasoning is therefore unreliable, and existing bias evaluations typically require predefined categories and hand-crafted datasets. In this work, we introduce a fully automated, black-box pipeline for detecting task-specific unverbalized biases. Given a task dataset, the pipeline uses LLM autoraters to generate candidate bias concepts. It then tests each concept on progressively larger input samples by generating positive and negative variations, and applies statistical techniques for multiple testing and early stopping. A concept is flagged as an unverbalized bias if it yields statistically significant performance differences while not being cited as justification in the model's CoTs. We evaluate our pipeline across six LLMs on three decision tasks (hiring, loan approval, and university admissions). Our technique automatically discovers previously unknown biases in these models (e.g., Spanish fluency, English proficiency, writing formality). In the same run, the pipeline also validates biases that were manually identified by prior work (gender, race, religion, ethnicity). More broadly, our proposed approach provides a practical, scalable path to automatic task-specific bias discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, Under review at ICML 2026</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Multiple Rotation Averaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10115v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multiple rotation averaging (MRA) is a fundamental optimization problem in 3D vision and robotics that aims to recover globally consistent absolute rotations from noisy relative measurements. Established classical methods, such as L1-IRLS and Shonan, face limitations including local minima susceptibility and reliance on convex relaxations that fail to preserve the exact manifold geometry, leading to reduced accuracy in high-noise scenarios. We introduce IQARS (Iterative Quantum Annealing for Rotation Synchronization), the first algorithm that reformulates MRA as a sequence of local quadratic non-convex sub-problems executable on quantum annealers after binarization, to leverage inherent hardware advantages. IQARS removes convex relaxation dependence and better preserves non-Euclidean rotation manifold geometry while leveraging quantum tunneling and parallelism for efficient solution space exploration. We evaluate IQARS's performance on synthetic and real-world datasets. While current annealers remain in their nascent phase and only support solving problems of limited scale with constrained performance, we observed that IQARS on D-Wave annealers can already achieve ca. 12% higher accuracy than Shonan, i.e., the best-performing classical method evaluated empirically.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures, 4 tables; project page: https://4dqv.mpi-inf.mpg.de/QMRA/</p></details> |
| **[ConsID-Gen: View-Consistent and Identity-Preserving Image-to-Video Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10113v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image-to-Video generation (I2V) animates a static image into a temporally coherent video sequence following textual instructions, yet preserving fine-grained object identity under changing viewpoints remains a persistent challenge. Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios. We will release our model and dataset at https://myangwu.github.io/ConsID-Gen.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://myangwu.github.io/ConsID-Gen</p></details> |
| **[ST4VLA: Spatially Guided Training for Vision-Language-Action Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10109v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large vision-language models (VLMs) excel at multimodal understanding but fall short when extended to embodied tasks, where instructions must be transformed into low-level motor actions. We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -> 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -> 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings. These results highlight scalable spatially guided training as a promising direction for robust, generalizable robot learning. Source code, data and models are released at https://internrobotics.github.io/internvla-m1.github.io/</p></details> | <details><summary>Spati...</summary><p>Spatially Training for VLA, Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Olaf-World: Orienting Latent Actions for Video World Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10104v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling action-controllable world models is limited by the scarcity of action labels. While latent action learning promises to extract control interfaces from unlabeled video, learned latents often fail to transfer across contexts: they entangle scene-specific cues and lack a shared coordinate system. This occurs because standard objectives operate only within each clip, providing no mechanism to align action semantics across contexts. Our key insight is that although actions are unobserved, their semantic effects are observable and can serve as a shared reference. We introduce Seq$Δ$-REPA, a sequence-level control-effect alignment objective that anchors integrated latent action to temporal feature differences from a frozen, self-supervised video encoder. Building on this, we present Olaf-World, a pipeline that pretrains action-conditioned video world models from large-scale passive video. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method learns a more structured latent action space, leading to stronger zero-shot action transfer and more data-efficient adaptation to new control interfaces than state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://showlab.github.io/Olaf-World/ Code: https://github.com/showlab/Olaf-World</p></details> |
| **[VideoWorld 2: Learning Transferable Knowledge from Real-world Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10102v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning transferable knowledge from unlabeled video data and applying it in new environments is a fundamental capability of intelligent agents. This work presents VideoWorld 2, which extends VideoWorld and offers the first investigation into learning transferable knowledge directly from raw real-world videos. At its core, VideoWorld 2 introduces a dynamic-enhanced Latent Dynamics Model (dLDM) that decouples action dynamics from visual appearance: a pretrained video diffusion model handles visual appearance modeling, enabling the dLDM to learn latent codes that focus on compact and meaningful task-related dynamics. These latent codes are then modeled autoregressively to learn task policies and support long-horizon reasoning. We evaluate VideoWorld 2 on challenging real-world handcraft making tasks, where prior video generation and latent-dynamics models struggle to operate reliably. Remarkably, VideoWorld 2 achieves up to 70% improvement in task success rate and produces coherent long execution videos. In robotics, we show that VideoWorld 2 can acquire effective manipulation knowledge from the Open-X dataset, which substantially improves task performance on CALVIN. This study reveals the potential of learning transferable world knowledge directly from raw videos, with all code, data, and models to be open-sourced for further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and models are released at: https://maverickren.github.io/VideoWorld2.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Learning on the Manifold: Unlocking Standard Diffusion Transformers with Representation Encoders](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10099v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging representation encoders for generative modeling offers a path for efficient, high-fidelity synthesis. However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

| **[The Complexity of Proper Equilibrium in Extensive-Form and Polytope Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10096v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proper equilibrium, introduced by Myerson (1978), is a classic refinement of the Nash equilibrium that has been referred to as the "mother of all refinements." For normal-form games, computing a proper equilibrium is known to be PPAD-complete for two-player games and FIXP$_a$-complete for games with at least three players. However, the complexity beyond normal-form games -- in particular, for extensive-form games (EFGs) -- was a long-standing open problem first highlighted by Miltersen and Sørensen (SODA '08). In this paper, we resolve this problem by establishing PPAD- and FIXP$_a$-membership (and hence completeness) of normal-form proper equilibria in two-player and multi-player EFGs respectively. Our main ingredient is a technique for computing a perturbed (proper) best response that can be computed efficiently in EFGs. This is despite the fact that, as we show, computing a best response using the classic perturbation of Kohlberg and Mertens based on the permutahedron is #P-hard even in Bayesian games. In stark contrast, we show that computing a proper equilibrium in polytope games is NP-hard. This marks the first natural class in which the complexity of computing equilibrium refinements does not collapse to that of Nash equilibria, and the first problem in which equilibrium computation in polytope games is strictly harder -- unless there is a collapse in the complexity hierarchy -- relative to extensive-form games.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper contains and extends results that were originally in a prior version of arXiv:2511.03968</p></details> |
| **[4RC: 4D Reconstruction via Conditional Querying Anytime and Anywhere](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10094v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present 4RC, a unified feed-forward framework for 4D reconstruction from monocular videos. Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yihangluo.com/projects/4RC/</p></details> |
| **[Quantum-Audit: Evaluating the Reasoning Limits of LLMs on Quantum Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10092v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have become practical tools for quantum computing education and research, from summarizing technical papers to explaining theoretical concepts and answering questions about recent developments in the field. While existing benchmarks evaluate quantum code generation and circuit design, their understanding of quantum computing concepts has not been systematically measured. Quantum-Audit addresses this gap with 2,700 questions covering core quantum computing topics. We evaluate 26 models from leading organizations. Our benchmark comprises 1,000 expert-written questions, 1,000 questions extracted from research papers using LLMs and validated by experts, plus an additional 700 questions including 350 open-ended questions and 350 questions with false premises to test whether models can correct erroneous assumptions. Human participants scored between 23% and 86%, with experts averaging 74%. Top-performing models exceeded the expert average, with Claude Opus 4.5 reaching 84% accuracy, though top models showed an average 12-point accuracy drop on expert-written questions compared to LLM-generated ones. Performance declined further on advanced topics, dropping to 73% on security questions. Additionally, models frequently accepted and reinforced false premises embedded in questions instead of identifying them, with accuracy below 66% on these critical reasoning tasks.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Agent World Model: Infinity Synthetic Environments for Agentic Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10090v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language model (LLM) have empowered autonomous agents to perform complex tasks that require multi-turn interactions with tools and environments. However, scaling such agent training is limited by the lack of diverse and reliable environments. In this paper, we propose Agent World Model (AWM), a fully synthetic environment generation pipeline. Using this pipeline, we scale to 1,000 environments covering everyday scenarios, in which agents can interact with rich toolsets (35 tools per environment on average) and obtain high-quality observations. Notably, these environments are code-driven and backed by databases, providing more reliable and consistent state transitions than environments simulated by LLMs. Moreover, they enable more efficient agent interaction compared with collecting trajectories from realistic environments. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this resource, we perform large-scale reinforcement learning for multi-turn tool-use agents. Thanks to the fully executable environments and accessible database states, we can also design reliable reward functions. Experiments on three benchmarks show that training exclusively in synthetic environments, rather than benchmark-specific ones, yields strong out-of-distribution generalization. The code is available at https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/agent-world-model.</p></details> | 41 pages |
| **[Story-Iter: A Training-free Iterative Paradigm for Long Story Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06244v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces Story-Iter, a new training-free iterative paradigm to enhance long-story generation. Unlike existing methods that rely on fixed reference images to construct a complete story, our approach features a novel external iterative paradigm, extending beyond the internal iterative denoising steps of diffusion models, to continuously refine each generated image by incorporating all reference images from the previous round. To achieve this, we propose a plug-and-play, training-free global reference cross-attention (GRCA) module, modeling all reference frames with global embeddings, ensuring semantic consistency in long sequences. By progressively incorporating holistic visual context and text constraints, our iterative paradigm enables precise generation with fine-grained interactions, optimizing the story visualization step-by-step. Extensive experiments in the official story visualization dataset and our long story benchmark demonstrate that Story-Iter's state-of-the-art performance in long-story visualization (up to 100 frames) excels in both semantic consistency and fine-grained interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 33 figures, The project page and associated code can be accessed via https://jwmao1.github.io/storyiter/</p></details> |
| **[CODE-SHARP: Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10085v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average. We will open-source our code and provide additional videos $\href{https://sites.google.com/view/code-sharp/homepage}{here}$.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Weak Enforcement and Low Compliance in PCI DSS: A Comparative Security Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13430v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although credit and debit card data continue to be a prime target for attackers, organizational adherence to the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) remains surprisingly low. Despite prior work showing that PCI DSS can reduce card fraud, only 32.4% of organizations were fully compliant in 2022, suggesting possible deficiencies in enforcement mechanisms. This study employs a comparative analysis (qualitative and indicator-based) to examine how enforcement mechanisms relate to implementation success in PCI DSS in relation to HIPAA, NIS2, and GDPR. The analysis reveals that PCI DSS significantly lags far behind these security frameworks and that its sanctions are orders of magnitude smaller than those under GDPR and NIS2. The findings indicate a positive association between stronger, multi-modal enforcement (including public disclosure, license actions, and imprisonment) and higher implementation rates, and highlight the structural weakness of PCI DSS's bank-dependent monitoring model. Enhanced non-monetary sanctions and the creation of an independent supervisory authority are recommended to increase transparency, reduce conflicts of interest, and improve PCI DSS compliance without discouraging card acceptance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |

Current approaches mainly redact all PII, disregarding the fact that some of them may be contextually relevant to the user's question, resulting in a degradation of response quality. Large language models (LLMs) might be able to help determine which PII are relevant, but due to their closed source nature and lack of privacy guarantees, they are unsuitable for sensitive data processing. To achieve privacy-preserving PII detection, we propose CAPID, a practical approach that fine-tunes a locally owned small language model (SLM) that filters sensitive information before it is passed to LLMs for QA. However, existing datasets do not capture the context-dependent relevance of PII needed to train such a model effectively. To fill this gap, we propose a synthetic data generation pipeline that leverages LLMs to produce a diverse, domain-rich dataset spanning multiple PII types and relevance levels. Using this dataset, we fine-tune an SLM to detect PII spans, classify their types, and estimate contextual relevance. Our experiments show that relevance-aware PII detection with a fine-tuned SLM substantially outperforms existing baselines in span, relevance and type accuracy while preserving significantly higher downstream utility under anonymization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the Student Research Workshop at EACL 2026</p></details> |
| **[The Complexity of Equilibrium Refinements in Potential Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03968v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complexity of computing equilibrium refinements has been at the forefront of algorithmic game theory research, but it has remained open in the seminal class of potential games; we close this fundamental gap in this paper. We first show that computing a pure(-strategy) perfect or proper equilibrium is $\mathsf{PLS}$-complete in concise potential games in normal form. For pure perfect equilibria, we extend this result to general polytope games, which includes extensive-form games. We next turn to more structured classes of games, namely symmetric network congestion and symmetric matroid congestion games. For both classes, we show that a pure perfect equilibrium can be computed in polynomial time, strengthening the existing results for pure Nash equilibria. More broadly, we make a connection between strongly polynomial-time algorithms and efficient perturbed optimization using fractional interpolation. On the other hand, we establish that, for a certain class of potential games, there is an exponential separation in the length of the best-response path between perfect and Nash equilibria. Finally, for mixed strategies, we prove that computing a point geometrically near a perfect equilibrium requires a doubly exponentially small perturbation even in $3$-player potential games in normal form. As a byproduct, this significantly strengthens and simplifies a seminal result of Etessami and Yannakakis (FOCS '07). On the flip side, in the special case of polymatrix potential games, we show that equilibrium refinements are amenable to perturbed gradient descent dynamics, thereby belonging to the complexity class $\mathsf{CLS}$. This provides a principled and practical way of refining the landscape of gradient descent in constrained optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The abstract has been abridged due to arXiv length constraints.

| **[Data-efficient and Interpretable Inverse Materials Design using a Disentangled Variational Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06740v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inverse materials design has proven successful in accelerating novel material discovery. Many inverse materials design methods use unsupervised learning where a latent space is learned to offer a compact description of materials representations. A latent space learned this way is likely to be entangled, in terms of the target property and other properties of the materials. This makes the inverse design process ambiguous. Here, we present a semi-supervised learning approach based on a disentangled variational autoencoder to learn a probabilistic relationship between features, latent variables and target properties. This approach is data efficient because it combines all labelled and unlabelled data in a coherent manner, and it uses expert-informed prior distributions to improve model robustness even with limited labelled data. It is in essence interpretable, as the learnable target property is disentangled out of the other properties of the materials, and an extra layer of interpretability can be provided by a post-hoc analysis of the classification head of the model. We demonstrate this new approach on an experimental high-entropy alloy dataset with chemical compositions as input and single-phase formation as the single target property. High-entropy alloys were chosen as example materials because of the vast chemical space of their possible combinations of compositions and atomic configurations. While single property is used in this work, the disentangled model can be extended to customize for inverse design of materials with multiple target properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/cengc13/d_vae_hea</p></details> |

Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2026, Project page: https://falcon-vla.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Disentangled Representations for Controllable Music Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10058v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent approaches in music generation rely on disentangled representations, often labeled as structure and timbre or local and global, to enable controllable synthesis. Yet the underlying properties of these embeddings remain underexplored. In this work, we evaluate such disentangled representations in a set of music audio models for controllable generation using a probing-based framework that goes beyond standard downstream tasks. The selected models reflect diverse unsupervised disentanglement strategies, including inductive biases, data augmentations, adversarial objectives, and staged training procedures. We further isolate specific strategies to analyze their effect. Our analysis spans four key axes: informativeness, equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement, which are assessed across datasets, tasks, and controlled transformations. Our findings reveal inconsistencies between intended and actual semantics of the embeddings, suggesting that current strategies fall short of producing truly disentangled representations, and prompting a re-examination of how controllability is approached in music generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

Unlike a formal computer, a language model is trained to autoregressively predict successive elements in human-generated text. We prove that chaining a language model's autoregressive output is sufficient to perform universal computation. That is, a language model can simulate the execution of any algorithm on any input. The challenge of eliciting desired computational behaviour can thus be reframed in terms of programmability: the ease of finding a suitable prompt. Strikingly, we demonstrate that even randomly initialized language models are capable of universal computation before training. This implies that training does not give rise to computational expressiveness -- rather, it improves programmability, enabling a natural language interface for accessing these intrinsic capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor formatting corrections</p></details> |
| **[The Architecture of Illusion: Network Opacity and Strategic Escalation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10053v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard models of bounded rationality typically assume agents either possess accurate knowledge of the population's reasoning abilities (Cognitive Hierarchy) or hold dogmatic, degenerate beliefs (Level-$k$). We introduce the ``Connected Minds'' model, which unifies these frameworks by integrating iterative reasoning with a parameterized network bias. We posit that agents do not observe the global population; rather, they observe a sample biased by their network position, governed by a locality parameter $p$ representing algorithmic ranking, social homophily, or information disclosure. We show that this parameter acts as a continuous bridge: the model collapses to the myopic Level-$k$ recursion as networks become opaque ($p \to 0$) and recovers the standard Cognitive Hierarchy model under full transparency ($p=1$). Theoretically, we establish that network opacity induces a \emph{Sophisticated Bias}, causing agents to systematically overestimate the cognitive depth of their opponents while preserving the log-concavity of belief distributions. This makes $p$ an actionable lever: a planner or platform can tune transparency -- globally or by segment (a personalized $p_k$) -- to shape equilibrium behavior. From a mechanism design perspective, we derive the \emph{Escalation Principle}: in games of strategic complements, restricting information can maximize aggregate effort by trapping agents in echo chambers where they compete against hallucinated, high-sophistication peers. Conversely, we identify a \emph{Transparency Reversal} for coordination games, where maximizing network visibility is required to minimize variance and stabilize outcomes. Our results suggest that network topology functions as a cognitive zoom lens, determining whether agents behave as local imitators or global optimizers.</p></details> | 34 pages, 6 figures |
| **[From Moderation to Mediation: Can LLMs Serve as Mediators in Online Flame Wars?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03005v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.</p></details> | Under review |

A Cost-Effective Approach Using Active Learning Markets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20605v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce and analyse active learning markets as a way to purchase labels, in situations where analysts aim to acquire additional data to improve model fitting, or to better train models for predictive analytics applications. This comes in contrast to the many proposals that already exist to purchase features and examples. By originally formalising the market clearing as an optimisation problem, we integrate budget constraints and improvement thresholds into the label acquisition process. We focus on a single-buyer-multiple-seller setup and propose the use of two active learning strategies (variance based and query-by-committee based), paired with distinct pricing mechanisms. They are compared to benchmark baselines including random sampling and a greedy knapsack heuristic. The proposed strategies are validated on real-world datasets from two critical application domains: real estate pricing and energy forecasting. Results demonstrate the robustness of our approach, consistently achieving superior performance with fewer labels acquired compared to conventional methods. Our proposal comprises an easy-to-implement practical solution for optimising data acquisition in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in INFORMS Journal on Data Science (IJDS).

However, excessively lengthy reasoning incurs substantial resource overhead, including token consumption and latency, which is particularly redundant when handling obviously generated forgeries. To address this issue, we propose Fake-HR1, a large-scale hybrid-reasoning model that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adaptively determine whether reasoning is necessary based on the characteristics of the generative detection task. To achieve this, we design a two-stage training framework: we first perform Hybrid Fine-Tuning (HFT) for cold-start initialization, followed by online reinforcement learning with Hybrid-Reasoning Grouped Policy Optimization (HGRPO) to implicitly learn when to select an appropriate reasoning mode. Experimental results show that Fake-HR1 adaptively performs reasoning across different types of queries, surpassing existing LLMs in both reasoning ability and generative detection performance, while significantly improving response efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

However, systematic research on MoE remains severely constrained by the prohibitive computational costs of training and evaluation, restricting large-scale studies accessible to most researchers. We introduce LibMoE, a unified framework for reproducible, efficient, and extensible MoE research that supports both pretraining and sparse-upcycling regimes. Beyond unified implementations, the framework provides transparent analytical tools for probing routing and expert dynamics. Leveraging this foundation, we conduct a comprehensive analysis along three dimensions: (i) routing dynamics, covering expert selection patterns, routing stability and optimality, and how routing entropy reveals task specialization and expert diversity; (ii) the effect of lightweight initialization on load balancing, demonstrating how subtle changes in router initialization shape early expert utilization; and (iii) training regime differences, revealing how sparse upcycling and full pretraining exhibit distinct routing patterns and stability profiles. By lowering the barrier to entry and standardizing evaluation, along with our comprehensive analysis, LibMoE broadens access to MoE research and establishes a reliable benchmark to guide future innovations.

Factorization machine with quantum annealing (FMQA) builds a quadratic surrogate model from evaluated samples and optimizes it on an Ising machine. However, FMQA requires binary decision variables, and for nonbinary structures such as integer permutations, the choice of binary encoding strongly affects search efficiency. If the encoding fails to reflect the original neighborhood structure, small Hamming moves may not correspond to meaningful modifications in the original solution space, and constrained problems can yield many infeasible candidates that waste evaluations. Recent work combines FMQA with a binary autoencoder (bAE) that learns a compact binary latent code from feasible solutions, yet the mechanism behind its performance gains is unclear. Using a small traveling salesman problem as an interpretable testbed, we show that the bAE reconstructs feasible tours accurately and, compared with manually designed encodings at similar compression, better aligns tour distances with latent Hamming distances, yields smoother neighborhoods under small bit flips, and produces fewer local optima. These geometric properties explain why bAE+FMQA improves the approximation ratio faster while maintaining feasibility throughout optimization, and they provide guidance for designing latent representations for black-box optimization.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Existing approaches address these challenges separately, either focusing on sway damping with predefined collision-free paths or performing collision avoidance only at the global planning level. We present the first collision-free, sway-damping model predictive controller (MPC) for a forestry crane that unifies both objectives in a single control framework. Our approach integrates LiDAR-based environment mapping directly into the MPC using online Euclidean distance fields (EDF), enabling real-time environmental adaptation. The controller simultaneously enforces collision constraints while damping payload sway, allowing it to (i) replan upon quasi-static environmental changes, (ii) maintain collision-free operation under disturbances, and (iii) provide safe stopping when no bypass exists. Experimental validation on a real forestry crane demonstrates effective sway damping and successful obstacle avoidance.

In particular, the model unlocks the Text-to-Video&Audio (T2VA) and Reference-to-Video&Audio (animation) capabilities compared to the T2V foundation models. To support the audio-visual synchronization and reference animation, we augment the popular MMDiT architecture with a joint audio-video branch which includes TA-CrossAttn for temporally-aligned cross-modal fusion and UniTemp-RoPE for precise audio-visual alignment. Meanwhile, a comprehensive data pipeline consisting of audio-video captioning, quality control, etc., is carefully designed to collect high-quality finetuning data. Additionally, we introduce a new benchmark to perform a comprehensive model test and comparison. After continue pretraining and finetuning on million-level high-quality data, ALIVE demonstrates outstanding performance, consistently outperforming open-source models and matching or surpassing state-of-the-art commercial solutions.

| **[Resilient Topology-Aware Coordination for Dynamic 3D UAV Networks under Node Failure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10029v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 3D Aerial-Ground Integrated Networks (AGINs), ensuring continuous service coverage under unexpected hardware failures is critical for mission-critical applications. While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) has shown promise in autonomous coordination, its resilience under sudden node failures remains a challenge due to dynamic topology deformation. This paper proposes a Topology-Aware Graph MAPPO (TAG-MAPPO) framework designed to enhance system survivability through autonomous 3D spatial reconfiguration. Our framework incorporates graph-based feature aggregation with a residual ego-state fusion mechanism to capture intricate inter-agent dependencies. This architecture enables the surviving swarm to rapidly adapt its topology compared to conventional Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) based approaches. Extensive simulations across heterogeneous environments, ranging from interference-limited Crowded Urban to sparse Rural areas, validate the proposed approach. The results demonstrate that TAG-MAPPO consistently outperforms baselines in both stability and efficiency; specifically, it reduces redundant handoffs by up to 50 percent while maintaining a lead in energy efficiency. Most notably, the framework exhibits exceptional self-healing capabilities following a catastrophic node failure. TAG-MAPPO restores over 90 percent of the pre-failure service coverage within 15 time steps, exhibiting a significantly faster V-shaped recovery trajectory than MLP baselines. Furthermore, in dense urban scenarios, the framework achieves a post-failure Jain's Fairness Index that even surpasses its original four-UAV configuration by effectively resolving service overlaps. These findings suggest that topology-aware coordination is essential for the realization of resilient 6G aerial networks and provides a robust foundation for adaptive deployments in volatile environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 5 figures.

In addition, to make the reasoning process transparent, a textual explanation is necessary to justify the verification result. However, most claim verification works mainly focus on the reasoning over textual evidence only or ignore the explainability, resulting in inaccurate and unconvincing verification. To address this problem, we propose a novel model that jointly achieves evidence retrieval, multi-modal claim verification, and explanation generation. For evidence retrieval, we construct a two-layer multi-modal graph for claims and evidence, where we design image-to-text and text-to-image reasoning for multi-modal retrieval. For claim verification, we propose token- and evidence-level fusion to integrate claim and evidence embeddings for multi-modal verification. For explanation generation, we introduce multi-modal Fusion-in-Decoder for explainability. Finally, since almost all the datasets are in general domain, we create a scientific dataset, AIChartClaim, in AI domain to complement claim verification community. Experiments show the strength of our model.</p></details> | Accepted to EACL-26 |

We propose METTLE (Multi-Edge Type with Touch-less Leading Edge), the first erasure code to meet all three requirements. Compared to "streaming RaptorQ" (RaptorQ configured with a small source block size to ensure a low decoding latency), METTLE is only slightly worse in coding efficiency, but 47.7 to 84.6 times faster to decode.</p></details> | 31 pages |

While such laws are established for large language models, they remain challenging for recommendation systems, especially those processing both user history and context features. We identify poor scaling efficiency as the main barrier to predictable power-law scaling, stemming from inefficient modules with low Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) and suboptimal resource allocation. We introduce Kunlun, a scalable architecture that systematically improves model efficiency and resource allocation. Our low-level optimizations include Generalized Dot-Product Attention (GDPA), Hierarchical Seed Pooling (HSP), and Sliding Window Attention. Our high-level innovations feature Computation Skip (CompSkip) and Event-level Personalization. These advances increase MFU from 17% to 37% on NVIDIA B200 GPUs and double scaling efficiency over state-of-the-art methods. Kunlun is now deployed in major Meta Ads models, delivering significant production impact.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |

Unlike text-to-video models, existing I2V pipelines often suffer from appearance drift and geometric distortion, artifacts we attribute to the sparsity of single-view 2D observations and weak cross-modal alignment. Here we address this problem from both data and model perspectives. First, we curate ConsIDVid, a large-scale object-centric dataset built with a scalable pipeline for high-quality, temporally aligned videos, and establish ConsIDVid-Bench, where we present a novel benchmarking and evaluation framework for multi-view consistency using metrics sensitive to subtle geometric and appearance deviations. We further propose ConsID-Gen, a view-assisted I2V generation framework that augments the first frame with unposed auxiliary views and fuses semantic and structural cues via a dual-stream visual-geometric encoder as well as a text-visual connector, yielding unified conditioning for a Diffusion Transformer backbone. Experiments across ConsIDVid-Bench demonstrate that ConsID-Gen consistently outperforms in multiple metrics, with the best overall performance surpassing leading video generation models like Wan2.1 and HunyuanVideo, delivering superior identity fidelity and temporal coherence under challenging real-world scenarios. We will release our model and dataset at https://myangwu.github.io/ConsID-Gen.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://myangwu.github.io/ConsID-Gen</p></details> |

We introduce ST4VLA, a dual-system Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages Spatial Guided Training to align action learning with spatial priors in VLMs. ST4VLA includes two stages: (i) spatial grounding pre-training, which equips the VLM with transferable priors via scalable point, box, and trajectory prediction from both web-scale and robot-specific data, and (ii) spatially guided action post-training, which encourages the model to produce richer spatial priors to guide action generation via spatial prompting. This design preserves spatial grounding during policy learning and promotes consistent optimization across spatial and action objectives. Empirically, ST4VLA achieves substantial improvements over vanilla VLA, with performance increasing from 66.1 -> 84.6 on Google Robot and from 54.7 -> 73.2 on WidowX Robot, establishing new state-of-the-art results on SimplerEnv. It also demonstrates stronger generalization to unseen objects and paraphrased instructions, as well as robustness to long-horizon perturbations in real-world settings. These results highlight scalable spatially guided training as a promising direction for robust, generalizable robot learning.

However, standard diffusion transformers fail to converge on these representations directly. While recent work attributes this to a capacity bottleneck proposing computationally expensive width scaling of diffusion transformers we demonstrate that the failure is fundamentally geometric. We identify Geometric Interference as the root cause: standard Euclidean flow matching forces probability paths through the low-density interior of the hyperspherical feature space of representation encoders, rather than following the manifold surface. To resolve this, we propose Riemannian Flow Matching with Jacobi Regularization (RJF). By constraining the generative process to the manifold geodesics and correcting for curvature-induced error propagation, RJF enables standard Diffusion Transformer architectures to converge without width scaling. Our method RJF enables the standard DiT-B architecture (131M parameters) to converge effectively, achieving an FID of 3.37 where prior methods fail to converge.

Unlike existing approaches that typically decouple motion from geometry or produce limited 4D attributes such as sparse trajectories or two-view scene flow, 4RC learns a holistic 4D representation that jointly captures dense scene geometry and motion dynamics. At its core, 4RC introduces a novel encode-once, query-anywhere and anytime paradigm: a transformer backbone encodes the entire video into a compact spatio-temporal latent space, from which a conditional decoder can efficiently query 3D geometry and motion for any query frame at any target timestamp. To facilitate learning, we represent per-view 4D attributes in a minimally factorized form by decomposing them into base geometry and time-dependent relative motion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that 4RC outperforms prior and concurrent methods across a wide range of 4D reconstruction tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://yihangluo.com/projects/4RC/</p></details> |

Yet the underlying properties of these embeddings remain underexplored. In this work, we evaluate such disentangled representations in a set of music audio models for controllable generation using a probing-based framework that goes beyond standard downstream tasks. The selected models reflect diverse unsupervised disentanglement strategies, including inductive biases, data augmentations, adversarial objectives, and staged training procedures. We further isolate specific strategies to analyze their effect. Our analysis spans four key axes: informativeness, equivariance, invariance, and disentanglement, which are assessed across datasets, tasks, and controlled transformations. Our findings reveal inconsistencies between intended and actual semantics of the embeddings, suggesting that current strategies fall short of producing truly disentangled representations, and prompting a re-examination of how controllability is approached in music generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

We first investigate this through formative interviews, documenting how seemingly benign content becomes harmful due to individual life experiences. Based on these insights, we developed DIY-MOD, a browser extension that operationalizes a new paradigm: personalized content transformation. Operating on a user's own definition of harm, DIY-MOD transforms sensitive elements within content in real-time instead of suppressing the content itself. The system selects the most appropriate transformation for a piece of content from a diverse palette--from obfuscation to artistic stylizing--to match the user's specific needs while preserving the content's informational value. Our two user studies demonstrate that this approach increases users' sense of agency and safety, enabling them to engage with content and communities they previously needed to avoid.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2026 |

However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it computes the desired robot behavior with the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge. Across seven simulated and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of SOTA baselines, while offering faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/K-UBM/</p></details> |

We address this by optimizing the behavior model that controls individual traffic participants. To improve efficiency, we adopt an instance-centric scene representation, where each traffic participant and map element is modeled in its own local coordinate frame. This design enables efficient, viewpoint-invariant scene encoding and allows static map tokens to be reused across simulation steps. To model interactions, we employ a query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings between local frames. We use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to learn the behavior model and propose an adaptive reward transformation that automatically balances robustness and realism during training.

We propose TabNSA, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Native Sparse Attention (NSA) with a TabMixer backbone to efficiently model tabular data. TabNSA tackles computational and representational challenges by dynamically focusing on relevant feature subsets per instance. The NSA module employs a hierarchical sparse attention mechanism, including token compression, selective preservation, and localized sliding windows, to significantly reduce the quadratic complexity of standard attention operations while addressing feature heterogeneity. Complementing this, the TabMixer backbone captures complex, non-linear dependencies through parallel multilayer perceptron (MLP) branches with independent parameters. These modules are synergistically combined via element-wise summation and mean pooling, enabling TabNSA to model both global context and fine-grained interactions. Extensive experiments across supervised and transfer learning settings show that TabNSA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning models. Furthermore, by augmenting TabNSA with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), we enable it to effectively address Few-Shot Learning challenges through language-guided generalization on diverse tabular benchmarks.

A primary bottleneck is the conversion of PQC reference codes from C to high-level synthesis (HLS) specifications, which requires extensive manual refactoring [1]-[3]. Another bottleneck is the scalability of synthesis for complex PQC primitives, including number theoretic transform (NTT) accelerators and wide memory interfaces. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable results for coding in general-purpose languages like Python, coding for hardware design is more challenging; feedback-driven and agentic integration are key principles of successful state-of-the-art approaches. Here, we propose LLM4PQC, an LLM-based agentic framework that refactors high-level PQC specifications and reference C codes into HLS-ready and synthesizable C code. Our framework generates and verifies the resulting RTL code. For correctness, we leverage a hierarchy of checks, covering fast C compilation and simulation as well as RTL simulation. Case studies on NIST PQC reference designs demonstrate a reduction in manual effort and accelerated design-space exploration compared to traditional flows. Overall, LLM4PQC provides a powerful and efficient pathway for synthesizing complex hardware accelerators.</p></details> | Submitted to DATE 26 |

However, efficient tactile data compression, which is essential for real-time robotic applications under strict bandwidth constraints, remains underexplored. The inherent heterogeneity and spatiotemporal complexity of tactile data further complicate this challenge. To bridge this gap, we introduce TaCo, the first comprehensive benchmark for Tactile data Codecs. TaCo evaluates 30 compression methods, including off-the-shelf compression algorithms and neural codecs, across five diverse datasets from various sensor types. We systematically assess both lossless and lossy compression schemes on four key tasks: lossless storage, human visualization, material and object classification, and dexterous robotic grasping. Notably, we pioneer the development of data-driven codecs explicitly trained on tactile data, TaCo-LL (lossless) and TaCo-L (lossy). Results have validated the superior performance of our TaCo-LL and TaCo-L. This benchmark provides a foundational framework for understanding the critical trade-offs between compression efficiency and task performance, paving the way for future advances in tactile perception.</p></details> | 27 pages |

There is proposed extension of KAN approach to neurons containing model of local joint distribution: $ρ(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{\mathbf{j}\in B} a_\mathbf{j} f_\mathbf{j}(\mathbf{x})$ for $\mathbf{x} \in [0,1]^d$, adding interpretation and information flow control to KAN, and allowing to gradually add missing 3 basic properties of biological: 1) biological axons propagate in both directions~\cite{axon}, while current artificial are focused on unidirectional propagation - joint distribution neurons can repair by substituting some variables, getting conditional values/distributions for the remaining. 2) Animals show risk avoidance~\cite{risk} requiring to process variance, and generally real world rather needs probabilistic models - the proposed can predict and propagate also distributions as vectors of moments: (expected value, variance) or higher. 3) biological neurons require local training, and beside backpropagation, the proposed allows many additional ways, like direct training, through tensor decomposition, or finally local and very promising: information bottleneck. Proposed approach is very general, can be also used as extension of softmax $\textrm{Pr}\propto \exp(-E)$ e.g. in embeddings of transformer, into their probability distributions working on $(a_j)$ few moments: $ρ(x)\approx \sum_j a_j f_j(x)$.</p></details> | 9 pages, 13 figures |

However, their massive computational cost and memory footprint hinder deployment on edge devices. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has proven effective for large language models (LLMs), directly applying existing methods to DiTs yields suboptimal results due to the neglect of the unique temporal dynamics inherent in diffusion processes. In this paper, we propose AdaTSQ, a novel PTQ framework that pushes the Pareto frontier of efficiency and quality by exploiting the temporal sensitivity of DiTs. First, we propose a Pareto-aware timestep-dynamic bit-width allocation strategy. We model the quantization policy search as a constrained pathfinding problem. We utilize a beam search algorithm guided by end-to-end reconstruction error to dynamically assign layer-wise bit-widths across different timesteps. Second, we propose a Fisher-guided temporal calibration mechanism. It leverages temporal Fisher information to prioritize calibration data from highly sensitive timesteps, seamlessly integrating with Hessian-based weight optimization. Extensive experiments on four advanced DiTs (e.g., Flux-Dev, Flux-Schnell, Z-Image, and Wan2.1) demonstrate that AdaTSQ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods like SVDQuant and ViDiT-Q.

Using synthetically generated processes with known temporal and cross-sectional dependency structures and varying signal-to-noise ratios, we conduct bootstrapped experiments that enable direct evaluation via out-of-sample correlations with the optimal ground-truth predictor. We show that two-way attention transformers, which alternate between temporal and cross-sectional self-attention, can outperform standard baselines-Lasso, boosting methods, and fully connected multilayer perceptrons-across a wide range of settings, including low signal-to-noise regimes. We further introduce a dynamic sparsification procedure for attention matrices applied during training, and demonstrate that it becomes significantly effective in noisy environments, where the correlation between the target variable and the optimal predictor is on the order of a few percent. Analysis of the learned attention patterns reveals interpretable structure and suggests connections to sparsity-inducing regularization in classical regression, providing insight into why these models generalize effectively under noise.</p></details> | Submitted to ICML |
| **[Kelix Technique Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09843v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) scale well by expressing diverse tasks as sequences of discrete natural-language tokens and training with next-token prediction, which unifies comprehension and generation under self-supervision. Extending this paradigm to multimodal data requires a shared, discrete representation across modalities. However, most vision-language models (VLMs) still rely on a hybrid interface: discrete text tokens paired with continuous Vision Transformer (ViT) features. Because supervision is largely text-driven, these models are often biased toward understanding and cannot fully leverage large-scale self-supervised learning on non-text data. Recent work has explored discrete visual tokenization to enable fully autoregressive multimodal modeling, showing promising progress toward unified understanding and generation. Yet existing discrete vision tokens frequently lose information due to limited code capacity, resulting in noticeably weaker understanding than continuous-feature VLMs. We present Kelix, a fully discrete autoregressive unified model that closes the understanding gap between discrete and continuous visual representations.</p></details> | Work in progress |

However, real-world videos typically contain long sequences with irregular camera trajectories and unknown poses, leading to pose drift, feature misalignment, and geometric distortion during reconstruction. Moreover, lossy compression amplifies these issues by introducing inconsistencies that gradually degrade geometry and rendering quality. While recent studies have addressed either long-sequence NVS or unposed reconstruction, compression-aware approaches still focus on specific artifacts or limited scenarios, leaving diverse compression patterns in long videos insufficiently explored. In this paper, we propose CompSplat, a compression-aware training framework that explicitly models frame-wise compression characteristics to mitigate inter-frame inconsistency and accumulated geometric errors. CompSplat incorporates compression-aware frame weighting and an adaptive pruning strategy to enhance robustness and geometric consistency, particularly under heavy compression. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including Tanks and Temples, Free, and Hike, demonstrate that CompSplat achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and pose accuracy, significantly surpassing most recent state-of-the-art NVS approaches under severe compression conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

However, they usually fail to produce satisfactory outputs that are aligned to users' authentic demands and preferences. In this work, we introduce Dual-Iterative Optimization (Dual-IPO), an iterative paradigm that sequentially optimizes both the reward model and the video generation model for improved synthesis quality and human preference alignment. For the reward model, our framework ensures reliable and robust reward signals via CoT-guided reasoning, voting-based self-consistency, and preference certainty estimation. Given this, we optimize video foundation models with guidance of signals from reward model's feedback, thus improving the synthesis quality in subject consistency, motion smoothness and aesthetic quality, etc. The reward model and video generation model complement each other and are progressively improved in the multi-round iteration, without requiring tediously manual preference annotations. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed Dual-IPO can effectively and consistently improve the video generation quality of base model with various architectures and sizes, even help a model with only 2B parameters surpass a 5B one. Moreover, our analysis experiments and ablation studies identify the rational of our systematic design and the efficacy of each component.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ICLR 2026</p></details> |

However, under lossy context compression in a compressor-decoder setup, we observe a Size-Fidelity Paradox: increasing the compressor size can lessen the faithfulness of reconstructed contexts though training loss decreases. Through extensive experiments across models from 0.6B to 90B, we coin this paradox arising from two dominant factors: 1) knowledge overwriting: larger models increasingly replace source facts with their own prior beliefs, e.g., ``the white strawberry'' $\to$ ``the red strawberry''; and 2) semantic drift: larger models tend to paraphrase or restructure content instead of reproducing it verbatim, e.g., ``Alice hit Bob'' $\to$ ``Bob hit Alice''. By holding model size fixed, we reflect on the emergent properties of compressed context representations. We show that the culprit is not parameter count itself, but the excessive semantic capacity and amplified generative uncertainty that accompany scaling. Specifically, the increased rank of context embeddings facilitates prior knowledge intrusion, whereas higher entropy over token prediction distributions promotes rewriting. Our results complement existing evaluations over context compression paradigm, underpinning a breakdown in scaling laws for faithful preservation in open-ended generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Block-Recurrent Dynamics in Vision Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19941v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent runtime. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.</p></details> | 25 pages, 15 figures |

Are they two views of the same underlying structure? We show they follow a single geometric principle: answer tokens, processed in isolation, encode the directions that would produce them. This Circuit Fingerprint hypothesis enables circuit discovery without gradients or causal intervention -- recovering comparable structure to gradient-based methods through geometric alignment alone. We validate this on standard benchmarks (IOI, SVA, MCQA) across four model families, achieving circuit discovery performance comparable to gradient-based methods. The same directions that identify circuit components also enable controlled steering -- achieving 69.8\% emotion classification accuracy versus 53.1\% for instruction prompting while preserving factual accuracy. Beyond method development, this read-write duality reveals that transformer circuits are fundamentally geometric structures: interpretability and controllability are two facets of the same object.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICML 2026. 15 pages, 11 figures</p></details> |

We show this is not merely an empirical regularity but a consequence of architectural necessity: transformers communicate information through linear interfaces (attention OV circuits, unembedding matrices), and any semantic feature decoded through such an interface must occupy a context-invariant linear subspace. We formalize this as the \emph{Invariant Subspace Necessity} theorem and derive the \emph{Self-Reference Property}: tokens directly provide the geometric direction for their associated features, enabling zero-shot identification of semantic structure without labeled data or learned probes. Empirical validation in eight classification tasks and four model families confirms the alignment between class tokens and semantically related instances. Our framework provides \textbf{a principled architectural explanation} for why linear interpretability methods work, unifying linear probes and sparse autoencoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICML 2026. 19 pages, 13 figures</p></details> |

Generalized Deduplication (GD) is a promising lossless compression framework, as it supports random access and direct analytics on compressed data. However, existing GD algorithms exhibit quadratic complexity $\mathcal{O}(nd^{2})$, which limits their scalability for high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes \textbf{EntroGD}, an entropy-guided GD framework that decouples analytical fidelity from compression efficiency to achieve linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(nd)$. EntroGD adopts a two-stage design, first constructing compact condensed samples to preserve information critical for analytics, and then applying entropy-based bit selection to maximize compression. Experiments on 18 IoT datasets show that EntroGD reduces configuration time by up to $53.5\times$ compared to state-of-the-art GD compressors. Moreover, by enabling analytics with access to only $2.6\%$ of the original data volume, EntroGD accelerates clustering by up to $31.6\times$ with negligible loss in accuracy. Overall, EntroGD provides a scalable and system-efficient solution for direct analytics on compressed IoT data.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 7 figures, accepted and to be presented at the IEEE INFOCOM 2026 Workshop on Fusion of Data, Operation, Information, and Communication Technology for Industry 4.0 and Society 5.0</p></details> |

However, the effectiveness of existing approaches degrades in massive editing scenarios, particularly when evaluated with practical metrics. Their robustness is also limited in context-rich settings or when editing multiple facts of the same subject simultaneously. We attribute these failures to the embedding misalignment among knowledge items, which undermines editing reliability at scale. To address this, we propose EAMET (Embedding Alignment Model Editing in Transformers), which addresses this issue by aligning the space of key and residual embeddings. Extensive experiments across six LLMs and three datasets demonstrate that EAMET consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving about 90\% editing efficacy when editing 10k facts.

UGround addresses two primary challenges posed by the prevailing paradigm: (1) its reliance on the fixed last hidden layer, which sequentially amplifies cumulative errors arising from layer-by-layer propagation without intermediate correction, and (2) its use of \texttt{<SEG>} as a prompt, which implicitly projects textual embeddings into visual space without explicit spatial cues (\eg, coordinates). Central to UGround is Policy-Prompted Masking, which comprises two key components: Stochastic Skip Connection (SSC) and Mask as Prompt (MasP). SSC is a reinforcement learning policy that, via stochastic sampling, allows each \texttt{<SEG>} token to slide across unrolled transformer layers, enabling dynamic layer selection at which it connects to the vision model (\eg, SAM) in a skip-connection fashion. Given the selected hidden layer, MasP uses the similarity map derived from the \texttt{<SEG>} token and image tokens as a soft logit mask to prompt SAM for mask generation, offering explicit spatial cues through its activation regions. To validate the effectiveness of UGround, we, for the first time, have unified visual grounding within a single framework from an attribute perspective, spanning from traditional refer expression segmentation to newly proposed reasoning segmentation, single-target to multi-target, positive query to false premise (empty target).

While access to quantum data can offer exponential advantages for carefully designed learning tasks and often under strong assumptions on the data distribution, it remains an open question whether such advantages persist in less structured settings and under more realistic, naturally occurring distributions. Motivated by these practical concerns, we introduce a systematic framework based on quantum lossy data compression to bound the power of quantum data in the context of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. Specifically, we provide lower bounds on the sample complexity of quantum learners for arbitrary functions when data is drawn from Zipf's distribution, a widely used model for the empirical distributions of real-world data. We also establish lower bounds on the size of quantum input data required to learn linear functions, thereby proving the optimality of previous positive results. Beyond learning theory, we show that our framework has applications in secure delegated quantum computation within the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) model. In particular, we constrain the amount of private information the server can infer, strengthening the security guarantees of the delegation protocol proposed in (Mantri et al., PRX, 2017).</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Artificial Intelligence (2025)</p></details> |

This study investigates federated learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution to collaboratively train robust surgical FMs. Methods: We introduce Federated EndoViT (FL-EndoViT), a federated framework that validates the Masked Autoencoder (MAE) pretraining strategy in a decentralized surgical setting. To ensure convergence under severe data heterogeneity, the architecture integrates adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization (FedSAM). Pretrained on the large-scale Endo700k dataset, FL-EndoViT is evaluated against a centralized baseline on different tasks including scene segmentation, action recognition, and phase recognition. Results: FedSAM is critical for successful pretraining, overcoming the convergence failures of standard federated methods. The resulting FL-EndoViT performs comparably to its centralized counterpart, with significant advantages in data-scarce, high-resolution segmentation and generalization to new surgical events. We also establish that full, end-to-end fine-tuning is necessary for optimal performance. Conclusion: This work validates FL with adaptive optimization as a viable paradigm for creating robust, privacy-preserving surgical FMs. Our findings provide a scalable framework for collaborative Surgical Data Science and underscore the optimizer's critical role in handling data heterogeneity. Future work should explore video-based models to incorporate spatiotemporal dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to MIDL</p></details> |

To address these issues, in this work, we propose S1-NexusAgent, a self-evolving agent framework designed for multidisciplinary scientific research. S1-NexusAgent adopts a hierarchical Plan-and-CodeAct execution paradigm, decoupling global scientific planning from subtask-level tool execution through a dual-loop architecture, thereby enabling stable modeling of complex research workflows. The system natively supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), integrates up to thousands of cross-disciplinary scientific tools, and achieves efficient orchestration of heterogeneous research tools via intention-aware dynamic tool retrieval and hot-plug mechanisms. To address long-context and large-scale data challenges in scientific settings, S1-NexusAgent introduces object-reference-based sparse context management, which enables sub-task context isolation and intermediate result compression. Building on this, a Critic Agent automatically evaluates complete execution trajectories and distills high-quality research paths into reusable Scientific Skills, forming a closed loop for continuous self-evolution, which is valuable for sustainable and long-horizon scientific research. Experiments on authoritative scientific benchmarks involving long-horizon planning and complex specialized tool orchestration, including biomini-eval (biology), ChemBench (chemistry), and MatSciBench (material science), demonstrate that S1-NexusAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generalization capability in complex scientific tasks.</p></details> | In progress |

However, their effectiveness depends critically on the quality and structure of input representations derived from raw multivariate time-series data, particularly as sequence length and data scale increase. This paper proposes a two-stage forecasting framework that explicitly separates local temporal representation learning from global dependency modelling. In the proposed approach, a convolutional neural network operates on fixed-length temporal patches to extract short-range temporal dynamics and non-linear feature interactions, producing compact patch-level token embeddings. Token-level self-attention is applied during representation learning to refine these embeddings, after which a Transformer encoder models inter-patch temporal dependencies to generate forecasts. The method is evaluated on a synthetic multivariate time-series dataset with controlled static and dynamic factors, using an extended sequence length and a larger number of samples. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms a convolutional baseline under increased temporal context and remains competitive with a strong patch-based Transformer model. These findings indicate that structured patch-level tokenization provides a scalable and effective representation for multivariate time-series forecasting, particularly when longer input sequences are considered.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

While recent approaches attempt to address this limitation by learning equivariant features using linear operators in feature space, they impose restrictive assumptions that constrain flexibility and generalization. We introduce a weaker definition for the transformation relation between image and feature space denoted as equivariance-coherence. We propose a novel SSL auxiliary task that learns equivariance-coherent representations through intermediate transformation reconstruction, which can be integrated with existing joint embedding SSL methods. Our key idea is to reconstruct images at intermediate points along transformation paths, e.g. when training on 30-degree rotations, we reconstruct the 10-degree and 20-degree rotation states. Reconstructing intermediate states requires the transformation information used in augmentations, rather than suppressing it, and therefore fosters features containing the augmented transformation information. Our method decomposes feature vectors into invariant and equivariant parts, training them with standard SSL losses and reconstruction losses, respectively. We demonstrate substantial improvements on synthetic equivariance benchmarks while maintaining competitive performance on downstream tasks requiring invariant representations. The approach seamlessly integrates with existing SSL methods (iBOT, DINOv2) and consistently enhances performance across diverse tasks, including segmentation, detection, depth estimation, and video dense prediction. Our framework provides a practical way for augmenting SSL methods with equivariant capabilities while preserving invariant performance.</p></details> | AAAI2026 oral |
| **[Modelling Socio-Psychological Drivers of Land Management Intensity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02347v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Land management intensity shapes ecosystem service provision, socio-ecological resilience and is central to sustainable transformation. Yet most land use models emphasise economic and biophysical drivers, while socio-psychological factors influencing land managers' decisions remain underrepresented despite increasing evidence that they shape land management choices. To address this gap, we develop a generic behavioural extension for agent-based land use models, guided by the Theory of Planned Behaviour as an overarching conceptual framework. The extension integrates environmental attitudes, descriptive social norms and behavioural inertia into land managers' decisions on land management intensity. To demonstrate applicability, the extension is coupled to an existing land use modelling framework and explored in stylised settings to isolate behavioural mechanisms. Results show that socio-psychological drivers can significantly alter land management intensity shares, landscape configuration, and ecosystem service provision. Nonlinear feedbacks between these drivers, spatial resource heterogeneity, and ecosystem service demand lead to emergent dynamics that are sometimes counter-intuitive and can diverge from the agent-level decision rules. Increasing the influence of social norms generates spatial clustering and higher landscape connectivity, while feedbacks between behavioural factors can lead to path dependence, lock-in effects, and the emergence of multiple stable regimes with sharp transitions. The proposed framework demonstrates how even low levels of behavioural diversity and social interactions can reshape system-level land use outcomes and provides a reusable modelling component for incorporating socio-psychological processes into land use simulations.

| **[Higher Hardness Results for the Reconfiguration of Odd Matchings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09573v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the reconfiguration of odd matchings of combinatorial graphs. Odd matchings are matchings that cover all but one vertex of a graph. A reconfiguration step, or flip, is an operation that matches the isolated vertex and, consequently, isolates another vertex. The flip graph of odd matchings is a graph that has all odd matchings of a graph as vertices and an edge between two vertices if their corresponding matchings can be transformed into one another via a single flip. We show that computing the diameter of the flip graph of odd matchings is $Π_2^p$-hard. This complements a recent result by Wulf [FOCS25] that it is~$Π_2^p$-hard to compute the diameter of the flip graph of perfect matchings where a flip swaps matching edges along a single cycle of unbounded size. Further, we show that computing the radius of the flip graph of odd matchings is $Σ_3^p$-hard. The respective decision problems for the diameter and the radius are also complete in the respective level of the polynomial hierarchy. This shows that computing the radius of the flip graph of odd matchings is provably harder than computing its diameter, unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses. Finally, we reduce set cover to the problem of finding shortest flip sequences. As a consequence, we show $\log$-\APX-hardness and that the problem cannot be approximated by a sublogarithmic factor. By doing so, we answer a question asked by Aichholzer, Brenner, Dorfer, Hoang, Perz, Rieck, and Verciani [GD25].</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at STACS26; To be merged with 2508.18457</p></details> |

We extend GraphCodeBERT with an explicit, low-dimensional behavioral feature that captures observable agreement between code fragments, and fuse this signal with the pooled transformer representation through a trainable output head. We compute behavioral agreement via output comparisons under a fixed test suite and use this observed output agreement as an operational approximation of semantic similarity between code pairs. The resulting feature acts as an explicit behavioral signature that complements token- and graph-based representations. Experiments on established clone detection benchmarks show consistent improvements in precision, recall, and F$_1$ over the unmodified GraphCodeBERT baseline, with the largest gains on semantically equivalent but syntactically dissimilar pairs. The source code that illustrates our approach can be downloaded from https://www.github.com/jorge-martinez-gil/graphcodebert-feature-integration.</p></details> | 16 pages |

However, due to the strong prior of large language models (LLMs) and misaligned attention across modalities, LVLMs often generate outputs inconsistent with visual content - termed hallucination. To address this, we propose \textbf{Scalpel}, a method that reduces hallucination by refining attention activation distributions toward more credible regions. Scalpel predicts trusted attention directions for each head in Transformer layers during inference and adjusts activations accordingly. It employs a Gaussian mixture model to capture multi-peak distributions of attention in trust and hallucination manifolds, and uses entropic optimal transport (equivalent to Schrödinger bridge problem) to map Gaussian components precisely. During mitigation, Scalpel dynamically adjusts intervention strength and direction based on component membership and mapping relationships between hallucination and trust activations. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and benchmarks demonstrate that Scalpel effectively mitigates hallucinations, outperforming previous methods and achieving state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, Scalpel is model- and data-agnostic, requiring no additional computation, only a single decoding step.</p></details> | <details><summary>WACV ...</summary><p>WACV 2026 (It was accepted in the first round, with an acceptance rate of 6%.)</p></details> |

Among existing methods, guiding the generation of frozen LLMs through autoregressive reward models (ARMs) to accomplish multi-objective test-time alignment is a low-cost solution. However, these methods typically rely on independent parameters for each preference objective, either by training ARMs independently across preference dimensions, which neglects interactions among preference features, or by training a single ARM with separate feature extraction modules for each preference, which can cause feature entanglement. Both strategies can result in misalignment between generated outputs and user preferences. To address this limitation, we propose Preference-Modulated \& Shared Low-Rank Adaptation (MoSLoRA) for ARM training, which first extracts shared features via a preference-agnostic module and then applies affine transformations to shared features via a preference modulation module conditioned on mixed preference vectors. This design mitigates feature entanglement and enables precise control over preference trade-offs during inference. Building on this, we introduce the Unified Autoregressive Reward Model (UniARM), a novel framework for multi-objective test-time alignment. UniARM jointly models all preference dimensions in a single parameter space, eliminating the need for independent parameters for each preference objective. es on larger-scale LLMs, enhancing its practical usability.</p></details> | Under Review |

One of its objectives is to foster interoperability and process information exchange. In this context, the integration of data from different providers, the combination of multiple processes, and the enhancement of knowledge inference are novel challenges. Semantic Web technologies can enable the creation of a machine-readable OCED description enriched through ontology-based relationships and entity categorization.

| **[Going with the Flow: Koopman Behavioral Models as Implicit Planners for Visuo-Motor Dexterity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07413v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been rapid and dramatic progress in learning complex visuo-motor manipulation skills from demonstrations, thanks in part to expressive policy classes that employ diffusion- and transformer-based backbones. However, these design choices require significant data and computational resources and remain far from reliable, particularly within the context of multi-fingered dexterous manipulation. Fundamentally, they model skills as reactive mappings and rely on fixed-horizon action chunking to mitigate jitter, creating a rigid trade-off between temporal coherence and reactivity. In this work, we introduce Unified Behavioral Models (UBMs), a framework that learns to represent dexterous skills as coupled dynamical systems that capture how visual features of the environment (visual flow) and proprioceptive states of the robot (action flow) co-evolve. By capturing such behavioral dynamics, UBMs can ensure temporal coherence by construction rather than by heuristic averaging. To operationalize these models, we propose Koopman-UBM, a first instantiation of UBMs that leverages Koopman Operator theory to effectively learn a unified representation in which the joint flow of latent visual and proprioceptive features is governed by a structured linear system. We demonstrate that Koopman-UBM can be viewed as an implicit planner: given an initial condition, it computes the desired robot behavior with the resulting flow of visual features over the entire skill horizon. To enable reactivity, we introduce an online replanning strategy in which the model acts as its own runtime monitor that automatically triggers replanning when predicted and observed visual flow diverge. Across seven simulated and two real-world tasks, we demonstrate that K-UBM matches or exceeds the performance of SOTA baselines, while offering faster inference, smooth execution, robustness to occlusions, and flexible replanning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes can be found at https://github.com/GT-STAR-Lab/K-UBM/</p></details> |
| **[Coupled Inference in Diffusion Models for Semantic Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09983v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many visual scenes can be described as compositions of latent factors. Effective recognition, reasoning, and editing often require not only forming such compositional representations, but also solving the decomposition problem. One popular choice for constructing these representations is through the binding operation. Resonator networks, which can be understood as coupled Hopfield networks, were proposed as a way to perform decomposition on such bound representations. Recent works have shown notable similarities between Hopfield networks and diffusion models. Motivated by these observations, we introduce a framework for semantic decomposition using coupled inference in diffusion models. Our method frames semantic decomposition as an inverse problem and couples the diffusion processes using a reconstruction-driven guidance term that encourages the composition of factor estimates to match the bound vector. We also introduce a novel iterative sampling scheme that improves the performance of our model. Finally, we show that attention-based resonator networks are a special case of our framework. Empirically, we demonstrate that our coupled inference framework outperforms resonator networks across a range of synthetic semantic decomposition tasks.</p></details> | 15 pages |

Under this approach, each model to be evaluated is treated as a canonical Kelly bettor, and the models are pitted against each other in an iterative betting contest. The growth or decline of each model's bankroll serves as the evaluation metric. Under this approach, market consensus probabilities and implied model credibilities can be updated real time as each model updates, and do not require one to wait for the final outcome. Using a simulation model, it will be shown that this method is in general more accurate than traditional average log-loss and Brier score methods at distinguishing a correct model from an incorrect model. This Kelly approach is shown to have a direct mathematical and conceptual analogue to Bayesian inference, with bankroll serving as a proxy for Bayesian credibility.</p></details> | 31 pages, 10 figures |

Existing caching techniques either preserve accuracy with low cache reuse or improve reuse at the cost of degraded reasoning quality. We present RAGBoost, an efficient RAG system that achieves high cache reuse without sacrificing accuracy through accuracy-preserving context reuse. RAGBoost detects overlapping retrieved items across concurrent sessions and multi-turn interactions, using efficient context indexing, ordering, and de-duplication to maximize reuse, while lightweight contextual hints maintain reasoning fidelity. It integrates seamlessly with existing LLM inference engines and improves their prefill performance by 1.5-3X over state-of-the-art methods, while preserving or even enhancing reasoning accuracy across diverse RAG and agentic AI workloads.

In parallel, inference scaling strategies such as Best-of-N Sampling and Majority Voting have likewise been shown to improve alignment and performance by trading additional computation for better output. However, existing prompt optimization approaches are inference strategy agnostic; that is, they optimize prompts without accounting for the inference strategy. This constitutes a significant methodological gap, as our empirical and theoretical analysis reveals a strong interdependence between these two paradigms. Moreover, we find that user preferences regarding trade-offs among multiple objectives and inference budgets substantially influence the choice of prompt and inference configuration. To address this gap, we introduce a novel unified framework named IAPO (Inference-Aware Prompt Optimization) that jointly optimizes the prompt and inference scale, while being aware of the inference budget and different task objectives. We then develop a fixed-budget training algorithm for IAPO, called PSST (Prompt Scaling via Sequential Trimming), and establish finite-budget guarantees on the error probability. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of PSST on six tasks, including multi-objective text generation and reasoning, and demonstrate the critical role of incorporating inference-awareness in aligning black-box LLMs using prompt optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

This paper introduces the Structurally Adaptive Predictive Inference Network (SAPIN), a novel computational model inspired by the principles of active inference and the morphological plasticity observed in biological neural cultures. SAPIN operates on a 2D grid where processing units, or cells, learn by minimizing local prediction errors. The model features two primary, concurrent learning mechanisms: a local, Hebbian-like synaptic plasticity rule based on the temporal difference between a cell's actual activation and its learned expectation, and a structural plasticity mechanism where cells physically migrate across the grid to optimize their information-receptive fields. This dual approach allows the network to learn both how to process information (synaptic weights) and also where to position its computational resources (network topology). We validated the SAPIN model on the classic Cart Pole reinforcement learning benchmark. Our results demonstrate that the architecture can successfully solve the CartPole task, achieving robust performance. The network's intrinsic drive to minimize prediction error and maintain homeostasis was sufficient to discover a stable balancing policy. We also found that while continual learning led to instability, locking the network's parameters after achieving success resulted in a stable policy. When evaluated for 100 episodes post-locking (repeated over 100 successful agents), the locked networks maintained an average 82% success rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Natio...</summary><p>National Science Foundation (NSF) workshop on Brain-Inspired Dynamics for Engineering Energy-Efficient Circuits and Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

We address this by optimizing the behavior model that controls individual traffic participants. To improve efficiency, we adopt an instance-centric scene representation, where each traffic participant and map element is modeled in its own local coordinate frame. This design enables efficient, viewpoint-invariant scene encoding and allows static map tokens to be reused across simulation steps. To model interactions, we employ a query-centric symmetric context encoder with relative positional encodings between local frames. We use Adversarial Inverse Reinforcement Learning to learn the behavior model and propose an adaptive reward transformation that automatically balances robustness and realism during training. Experiments demonstrate that our approach scales efficiently with the number of tokens, significantly reducing training and inference times, while outperforming several agent-centric baselines in terms of positional accuracy and robustness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication by IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA 2026)</p></details> |

We introduce ParisKV, a drift-robust, GPU-native KV-cache retrieval framework based on collision-based candidate selection, followed by a quantized inner-product reranking estimator. For million-token contexts, ParisKV supports CPU-offloaded KV caches via Unified Virtual Addressing (UVA), enabling on-demand top-$k$ fetching with minimal overhead. ParisKV matches or outperforms full attention quality on long-input and long-generation benchmarks. It achieves state-of-the-art long-context decoding efficiency: it matches or exceeds full attention speed even at batch size 1 for long contexts, delivers up to 2.8$\times$ higher throughput within full attention's runnable range, and scales to million-token contexts where full attention runs out of memory. At million-token scale, ParisKV reduces decode latency by 17$\times$ and 44$\times$ compared to MagicPIG and PQCache, respectively, two state-of-the-art KV-cache Top-$k$ retrieval baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 16 figures.

Distributing rollout execution offers opportunities to leverage more cost-efficient inference resources, but introduces challenges in wide-area coordination and policy dissemination. We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers. Experiments on GRPO post-training of 4B and 8B models under real wide-area bandwidth regimes show that ECHO-2 significantly improves cost efficiency while preserving RL reward comparable to strong baselines.</p></details> | 23 pages, 7 figures |

In this work, we propose an adaptive sampling scheme that generates data while simultaneously stabilizing the system to avoid instabilities during the data collection. Under mild assumptions, the approach provably generates data sets that are informative for stabilization and have minimal size. The numerical experiments demonstrate that controller inference with the novel adaptive sampling approach learns controllers with up to one order of magnitude fewer data samples than unguided data generation. The results show that the proposed approach opens the door to stabilizing systems in edge cases and limit states where instabilities often occur and data collection is inherently difficult.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |

A primary bottleneck is the conversion of PQC reference codes from C to high-level synthesis (HLS) specifications, which requires extensive manual refactoring [1]-[3]. Another bottleneck is the scalability of synthesis for complex PQC primitives, including number theoretic transform (NTT) accelerators and wide memory interfaces. While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable results for coding in general-purpose languages like Python, coding for hardware design is more challenging; feedback-driven and agentic integration are key principles of successful state-of-the-art approaches. Here, we propose LLM4PQC, an LLM-based agentic framework that refactors high-level PQC specifications and reference C codes into HLS-ready and synthesizable C code. Our framework generates and verifies the resulting RTL code. For correctness, we leverage a hierarchy of checks, covering fast C compilation and simulation as well as RTL simulation. Case studies on NIST PQC reference designs demonstrate a reduction in manual effort and accelerated design-space exploration compared to traditional flows. Overall, LLM4PQC provides a powerful and efficient pathway for synthesizing complex hardware accelerators.</p></details> | Submitted to DATE 26 |
| **[CARINOX: Inference-time Scaling with Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise Optimization and Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17458v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships, attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning. While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone: optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image quality and diversity.

Existing stem generation approaches, however, either rely on fixed architectures that output a predefined set of stems in parallel, or generate only one stem at a time, resulting in slow inference despite flexibility in stem combination. We propose Stemphonic, a diffusion-/flow-based framework that overcomes this trade-off and generates a variable set of synchronized stems in one inference pass. During training, we treat each stem as a batch element, group synchronized stems in a batch, and apply a shared noise latent to each group. At inference-time, we use a shared initial noise latent and stem-specific text inputs to generate synchronized multi-stem outputs in one pass. We further expand our approach to enable one-pass conditional multi-stem generation and stem-wise activity controls to empower users to iteratively generate and orchestrate the temporal layering of a mix. We benchmark our results on multiple open-source stem evaluation sets and show that Stemphonic produces higher-quality outputs while accelerating the full mix generation process by 25 to 50%.

However, the high deployment cost hinders their scalability. To tackle the issues, Spatial Interpolation (SI) introduces virtual sensors to infer readings from observed sensors, leveraging graph structure. However, current graph-based SI methods rely on pre-trained models, lack adaptation to larger and unseen graphs at test-time, and overlook test data utilization. To address these issues, we propose PlugSI, a plug-and-play framework that refines test-time graph through two key innovations. First, we design an Unknown Topology Adapter (UTA) that adapts to the new graph structure of each small-batch at test-time, enhancing the generalization of SI pre-trained models. Second, we introduce a Temporal Balance Adapter (TBA) that maintains a stable historical consensus to guide UTA adaptation and prevent drifting caused by noise in the current batch. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate PlugSI can be seamlessly integrated into existing graph-based SI methods and provide significant improvement (e.g., a 10.81% reduction in MAE).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DASFAA 2026 (Full Research Paper)</p></details> |

We introduce a trace-optional framework that decomposes token efficiency into interpretable factors: completion under a fixed token budget (avoiding truncation), conditional correctness given completion, and verbosity (token usage). When benchmark metadata provides per-instance workload proxies, we further factor verbosity into two components: mean verbalization overhead (tokens per work unit) and a coupling coefficient capturing how overhead scales with task workload. When reasoning traces are available, we add deterministic trace-quality measures (grounding, repetition, prompt copying) to separate degenerate looping from verbose-but-engaged reasoning, avoiding human labeling and LLM judges. Evaluating 25 models on CogniLoad, we find that accuracy and token-efficiency rankings diverge (Spearman $ρ=0.63$), efficiency gaps are often driven by conditional correctness, and verbalization overhead varies by about 9 times (only weakly related to model scale). Our decomposition reveals distinct bottleneck profiles that suggest different efficiency interventions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint (under review). 29 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

While Minecraft has emerged as a compelling benchmark, existing agents often suffer from fragmented cognitive abilities, lacking the synergy between reflexive execution (System 1) and deliberative reasoning (System 2). In this paper, we introduce Optimus-3, a generalist agent that organically integrates these dual capabilities within a unified framework. To achieve this, we address three fundamental challenges. First, to overcome the scarcity of reasoning data, we propose a Knowledge-Enhanced Automated Data Generation Pipeline. It synthesizes high-quality System 2 reasoning traces from raw System 1 interaction trajectories, effectively mitigating hallucinations via injection of domain knowledge. We release the resulting dataset, \textbf{OptimusM$^{4}$}, to the community. Second, to reconcile the dichotomous computational requirements of the dual systems, we design a Dual-Router Aligned MoE Architecture. It employs a Task Router to prevent task interference via parameter decoupling, and a Layer Router to dynamically modulate reasoning depth, creating a computational ``Fast Path'' for System 1 and a ``Deep Path'' for System 2. Third, to activate the reasoning capabilities of System 2, we propose Dual-Granularity Reasoning-Aware Policy Optimization (DGRPO) algorithm. It enforces Process-Outcome Co-Supervision via dual-granularity dense rewards, ensuring consistency between the thought process and the answer. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Optimus-3 surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods on both System~2 (21$\%$ on Planning, 66\% on Captioning, 76\% on Embodied QA, 3.4$\times$ on Grounding, and 18\% on Reflection) and System~1 (3\% on Long-Horizon Action) tasks, with a notable 60\% success rate on open-ended tasks.</p></details> | 16 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Bayesian identification of early warning signals for long-range dependent climatic time series](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09731v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting early warning signals in climatic time series is essential for anticipating critical transitions and tipping points. Common statistical indicators include increased variance and lag-one autocorrelation prior to bifurcation points. However, these indicators are sensitive to observational noise, long-term mean trends, and long-memory dependence, all of which are prevalent in climatic time series. Such effects can easily obscure genuine signals or generate spurious detections. To address these challenges, we employ a flexible Bayesian framework for modelling time-varying autocorrelation in long-range dependent time series, also accounting for time-varying variance. The approach uses a mixture of two fractional Gaussian noise processes with a time-dependent weight function to represent fractional Gaussian noise with a time-varying Hurst exponent. Inference is performed via integrated nested Laplace approximation, enabling joint estimation of mean trends and handling of irregularly sampled observations. The strengths and limitations of detecting changes in the autocorrelation is investigated in extensive simulations. Applied to real climatic data sets, we find evidence of early warning signals in a reconstructed Atlantic multidecadal variability index, while dismissing such signals for paleoclimate records spanning the Dansgaard-Oeschger events.</p></details> | 27 pages, 9 figures |
| **[PersonaX: Multimodal Datasets with LLM-Inferred Behavior Traits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11362v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding human behavior traits is central to applications in human-computer interaction, computational social science, and personalized AI systems. Such understanding often requires integrating multiple modalities to capture nuanced patterns and relationships. However, existing resources rarely provide datasets that combine behavioral descriptors with complementary modalities such as facial attributes and biographical information. To address this gap, we present PersonaX, a curated collection of multimodal datasets designed to enable comprehensive analysis of public traits across modalities. PersonaX consists of (1) CelebPersona, featuring 9444 public figures from diverse occupations, and (2) AthlePersona, covering 4181 professional athletes across 7 major sports leagues. Each dataset includes behavioral trait assessments inferred by three high-performing large language models, alongside facial imagery and structured biographical features. We analyze PersonaX at two complementary levels. First, we abstract high-level trait scores from text descriptions and apply five statistical independence tests to examine their relationships with other modalities. Second, we introduce a novel causal representation learning (CRL) framework tailored to multimodal and multi-measurement data, providing theoretical identifiability guarantees. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By unifying structured and unstructured analysis, PersonaX establishes a foundation for studying LLM-inferred behavioral traits in conjunction with visual and biographical attributes, advancing multimodal trait analysis and causal reasoning.

| **[BRAVA-GNN: Betweenness Ranking Approximation Via Degree MAss Inspired Graph Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09716v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing node importance in networks is a long-standing fundamental problem that has driven extensive study of various centrality measures. A particularly well-known centrality measure is betweenness centrality, which becomes computationally prohibitive on large-scale networks. Graph Neural Network (GNN) models have thus been proposed to predict node rankings according to their relative betweenness centrality. However, state-of-the-art methods fail to generalize to high-diameter graphs such as road networks. We propose BRAVA-GNN, a lightweight GNN architecture that leverages the empirically observed correlation linking betweenness centrality to degree-based quantities, in particular multi-hop degree mass. This correlation motivates the use of degree masses as size-invariant node features and synthetic training graphs that closely match the degree distributions of real networks. Furthermore, while previous work relies on scale-free synthetic graphs, we leverage the hyperbolic random graph model, which reproduces power-law exponents outside the scale-free regime, better capturing the structure of real-world graphs like road networks. This design enables BRAVA-GNN to generalize across diverse graph families while using 54x fewer parameters than the most lightweight existing GNN baseline. Extensive experiments on 19 real-world networks, spanning social, web, email, and road graphs, show that BRAVA-GNN achieves up to 214% improvement in Kendall-Tau correlation and up to 70x speedup in inference time over state-of-the-art GNN-based approaches, particularly on challenging road networks.</p></details> | Submitted to KDD |
| **[Fast Motion Planning for Non-Holonomic Mobile Robots via a Rectangular Corridor Representation of Structured Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09714v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a complete framework for fast motion planning of non-holonomic autonomous mobile robots in highly complex but structured environments. Conventional grid-based planners struggle with scalability, while many kinematically-feasible planners impose a significant computational burden due to their search space complexity. To overcome these limitations, our approach introduces a deterministic free-space decomposition that creates a compact graph of overlapping rectangular corridors. This method enables a significant reduction in the search space, without sacrificing path resolution. The framework then performs online motion planning by finding a sequence of rectangles and generating a near-time-optimal, kinematically-feasible trajectory using an analytical planner. The result is a highly efficient solution for large-scale navigation. We validate our framework through extensive simulations and on a physical robot. The implementation is publicly available as open-source software.</p></details> | ICRA 2026 |
| **[Information-Theoretic Limits of Quantum Learning via Data Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.06841v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the power of quantum data in machine learning is central to many proposed applications of quantum technologies. While access to quantum data can offer exponential advantages for carefully designed learning tasks and often under strong assumptions on the data distribution, it remains an open question whether such advantages persist in less structured settings and under more realistic, naturally occurring distributions. Motivated by these practical concerns, we introduce a systematic framework based on quantum lossy data compression to bound the power of quantum data in the context of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning. Specifically, we provide lower bounds on the sample complexity of quantum learners for arbitrary functions when data is drawn from Zipf's distribution, a widely used model for the empirical distributions of real-world data. We also establish lower bounds on the size of quantum input data required to learn linear functions, thereby proving the optimality of previous positive results. Beyond learning theory, we show that our framework has applications in secure delegated quantum computation within the measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) model. In particular, we constrain the amount of private information the server can infer, strengthening the security guarantees of the delegation protocol proposed in (Mantri et al., PRX, 2017).</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version accepted at the IEEE International Conference on Quantum Artificial Intelligence (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Physics-informed diffusion models in spectral space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09708v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a methodology that combines generative latent diffusion models with physics-informed machine learning to generate solutions of parametric partial differential equations (PDEs) conditioned on partial observations, which includes, in particular, forward and inverse PDE problems. We learn the joint distribution of PDE parameters and solutions via a diffusion process in a latent space of scaled spectral representations, where Gaussian noise corresponds to functions with controlled regularity. This spectral formulation enables significant dimensionality reduction compared to grid-based diffusion models and ensures that the induced process in function space remains within a class of functions for which the PDE operators are well defined. Building on diffusion posterior sampling, we enforce physics-informed constraints and measurement conditions during inference, applying Adam-based updates at each diffusion step. We evaluate the proposed approach on Poisson, Helmholtz, and incompressible Navier--Stokes equations, demonstrating improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared with existing diffusion-based PDE solvers, which are state of the art for sparse observations.

| **[Breaking the Simplification Bottleneck in Amortized Neural Symbolic Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08885v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Symbolic regression (SR) aims to discover interpretable analytical expressions that accurately describe observed data. Amortized SR promises to be much more efficient than the predominant genetic programming SR methods, but currently struggles to scale to realistic scientific complexity. We find that a key obstacle is the lack of a fast reduction of equivalent expressions to a concise normalized form. Amortized SR has addressed this by general-purpose Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) like SymPy, but the high computational cost severely limits training and inference speed. We propose SimpliPy, a rule-based simplification engine achieving a 100-fold speed-up over SymPy at comparable quality. This enables substantial improvements in amortized SR, including scalability to much larger training sets, more efficient use of the per-expression token budget, and systematic training set decontamination with respect to equivalent test expressions. We demonstrate these advantages in our Flash-ANSR framework, which achieves much better accuracy than amortized baselines (NeSymReS, E2E) on the FastSRB benchmark. Moreover, it performs on par with state-of-the-art direct optimization (PySR) while recovering more concise instead of more complex expressions with increasing inference budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main text: 8 pages, 7 figures; appendix: 12 pages, 11 figures; code available at https://github.com/psaegert/simplipy and https://github.com/psaegert/flash-ansr; v2: Fixed rendering artifact in Figure 7</p></details> |
| **[Bayesian Speech Synthesizers Can Learn from Multiple Teachers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24372v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-Speech (TTS) is inherently a "one-to-many" mapping characterized by intrinsic uncertainty, yet current paradigms often oversimplify it into a deterministic regression task. While continuous-valued autoregressive (AR) models have recently emerged as a promising alternative to discrete codec-based approaches, they typically rely on a fixed-variance prior, fundamentally constraining generation to a static point estimate that ignores the dynamic variability of natural speech. To bridge this gap, we propose BELLE (Bayesian evidential learning with language modelling), a framework that shifts from deterministic prediction to principled Bayesian inference without increasing model parameters or inference latency. By modeling the acoustic target as a Normal-Inverse-Gamma distribution, BELLE captures data-dependent aleatoric uncertainty. To enable accurate variance estimation on standard single-reference datasets, we introduce a "one-to-many" training strategy that leverages synthetic samples as a statistical support set, allowing the model to learn robust distributional properties rather than merely imitating teacher artifacts. Experiments demonstrate that BELLE, trained on only ~5k hours of data, outperforms leading open-source models trained on 50k hours (achieving a 25.8% relative WER reduction) and naturally supports high-quality streaming generation. Audio samples are available at https://belletts.github.io/Belle/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code is available at https://github.com/OpenTSLab/BELLE</p></details> |
| **[Complete Fusion for Stateful Streams: Equational Theory of Stateful Streams and Fusion as Normalization-by-Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15768v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Processing large amounts of data fast, in constant and small space is the point of stream processing and the reason for its increasing use. Alas, the most performant, imperative processing code tends to be almost impossible to read, let alone modify, reuse -- or write correctly. We present both a stream compilation theory and its implementation as a portable stream processing library Strymonas that lets us assemble complex stream pipelines just by plugging in simple combinators, and yet attain the performance of hand-written imperative loops and state machines. The library supports finite and infinite streams and offers a rich set of combinators. They may be freely composed, and yet the resulting convoluted imperative code has no traces of combinator abstractions: no closures or intermediate objects. The high-performance is portable and statically guaranteed, without relying on compiler or black-box optimizations. We greatly exceed in performance the available stream processing libraries in OCaml. The library generates C and OCaml code. The declaratively built Strymonas pipelines are all stateful. The stream state introduced in the library is not directly observable. Therefore, the Strymonas API looks like the familiar interface of `pure functional' combinators. Programmers may introduce their own stream state and share it across the pipeline. Strymonas has been developed in tandem with the equational theory of stateful streams. Our theoretical model represents all desired pipelines and guarantees the existence of unique normal forms, which are mappable to (fused) state machines. We describe the normalization algorithm, as a form of normalization-by-evaluation. The equational theory lets us state and prove the correctness of the complete fusion optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised based on many comments</p></details> |
| **[Principled priors for Bayesian inference of circular models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18223v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in computational power and methodologies have enabled research on massive datasets. However, tools for analyzing data with directional or periodic characteristics, such as wind directions and customers' arrival time in 24-hour clock, remain underdeveloped. While statisticians have proposed circular distributions for such analyses, significant challenges persist in constructing circular statistical models, particularly in the context of Bayesian methods. These challenges stem from limited theoretical development and a lack of historical studies on prior selection for circular distribution parameters. In this article, we propose a principled, practical and systematic framework for selecting priors that effectively prevents overfitting in circular scenarios, especially when there is insufficient information to guide prior selection. We introduce well-examined Penalized Complexity (PC) priors for the most widely used circular distributions. Comprehensive comparisons with existing priors in the literature are conducted through simulation studies and a practical case study. Finally, we discuss the contributions and implications of our work, providing a foundation for further advancements in constructing Bayesian circular statistical models.</p></details> | 46 pages, 21 figures |
