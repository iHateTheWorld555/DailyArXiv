| **[Experimental End-to-End Optimization of Directly Modulated Laser-based IM/DD Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19910v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Directly modulated lasers (DMLs) are an attractive technology for short-reach intensity modulation and direct detection communication systems. However, their complex nonlinear dynamics make the modeling and optimization of DML-based systems challenging. In this paper, we study the end-to-end optimization of DML-based systems based on a data-driven surrogate model trained on experimental data. The end-to-end optimization includes the pulse shaping and equalizer filters, the bias current and the modulation radio-frequency (RF) power applied to the laser. The performance of the end-to-end optimization scheme is tested on the experimental setup and compared to 4 different benchmark schemes based on linear and nonlinear receiver-side equalization. The results show that the proposed end-to-end scheme is able to deliver better performance throughout the studied symbol rates and transmission distances while employing lower modulation RF power, fewer filter taps and utilizing a smaller signal bandwidth.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 10 figures, published in journal of lightwave technology</p></details> |
| **[Pruning as a Game: Equilibrium-Driven Sparsification of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22106v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network pruning is widely used to reduce model size and computational cost. Yet, most existing methods treat sparsity as an externally imposed constraint, enforced through heuristic importance scores or training-time regularization. In this work, we propose a fundamentally different perspective: pruning as an equilibrium outcome of strategic interaction among model components. We model parameter groups such as weights, neurons, or filters as players in a continuous non-cooperative game, where each player selects its level of participation in the network to balance contribution against redundancy and competition. Within this formulation, sparsity emerges naturally when continued participation becomes a dominated strategy at equilibrium. We analyze the resulting game and show that dominated players collapse to zero participation under mild conditions, providing a principled explanation for pruning behavior. Building on this insight, we derive a simple equilibrium-driven pruning algorithm that jointly updates network parameters and participation variables without relying on explicit importance scores. This work focuses on establishing a principled formulation and empirical validation of pruning as an equilibrium phenomenon, rather than exhaustive architectural or large-scale benchmarking. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves competitive sparsity-accuracy trade-offs while offering an interpretable, theory-grounded alternative to existing pruning methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

| **[Learning Association via Track-Detection Matching for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22105v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-object tracking aims to maintain object identities over time by associating detections across video frames. Two dominant paradigms exist in literature: tracking-by-detection methods, which are computationally efficient but rely on handcrafted association heuristics, and end-to-end approaches, which learn association from data at the cost of higher computational complexity. We propose Track-Detection Link Prediction (TDLP), a tracking-by-detection method that performs per-frame association via link prediction between tracks and detections, i.e., by predicting the correct continuation of each track at every frame. TDLP is architecturally designed primarily for geometric features such as bounding boxes, while optionally incorporating additional cues, including pose and appearance. Unlike heuristic-based methods, TDLP learns association directly from data without handcrafted rules, while remaining modular and computationally efficient compared to end-to-end trackers. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that TDLP consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance across both tracking-by-detection and end-to-end methods. Finally, we provide a detailed analysis comparing link prediction with metric learning-based association and show that link prediction is more effective, particularly when handling heterogeneous features such as detection bounding boxes. Our code is available at \href{https://github.com/Robotmurlock/TDLP}{https://github.com/Robotmurlock/TDLP}.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (+4 for references), 8 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Explainable Multimodal Regression via Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22102v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal regression aims to predict a continuous target from heterogeneous input sources and typically relies on fusion strategies such as early or late fusion. However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference. Implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaozhaoma/PIDReg.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/zhaozhaoma/PIDReg</p></details> |
| **[Rewards-based image analysis in microscopy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18522v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Imaging and hyperspectral data analysis is central to progress across biology, medicine, chemistry, and physics. The core challenge lies in converting high-resolution or high-dimensional datasets into interpretable representations that enable insight into the underlying physical or chemical properties of a system. Traditional analysis relies on expert-designed, multistep workflows, such as denoising, feature extraction, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and physics-based deconvolution, or on machine learning (ML) methods that accelerate individual steps. Both approaches, however, typically demand significant human intervention, including hyperparameter tuning and data labeling. Achieving the next level of autonomy in scientific imaging requires designing effective reward-based workflows that guide algorithms toward best data representation for human or automated decision-making. Here, we discuss recent advances in reward-based workflows for image analysis, which capture key elements of human reasoning and exhibit strong transferability across various tasks. We highlight how reward-driven approaches enable a shift from supervised black-box models toward explainable, unsupervised optimization on the examples of Scanning Probe and Electron Microscopies. Such reward-based frameworks are promising for a broad range of applications, including classification, regression, structure-property mapping, and general hyperspectral data processing.</p></details> | 41 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Introducing TrGLUE and SentiTurca: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Turkish General Language Understanding and Sentiment Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22100v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the performance of various model architectures, such as transformers, large language models (LLMs), and other NLP systems, requires comprehensive benchmarks that measure performance across multiple dimensions. Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review by Springer</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Microenvironment Trajectories on Spatial Transcriptomics with NicheFlow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00977v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the evolution of cellular microenvironments in spatiotemporal data is essential for deciphering tissue development and disease progression. While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Schwarz Information Criterion Aided Multi-Armed Bandit for Decentralized Resource Allocation in Dynamic LoRa Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22089v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a lightweight distributed learning method for transmission parameter selection in Long Range (LoRa) networks that can adapt to dynamic communication environments. In the proposed method, each LoRa End Device (ED) employs the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)1-tuned algorithm to select transmission parameters including channel, transmission power, and bandwidth. The transmission parameters are selected based on the acknowledgment (ACK) feedback returned from the gateway after each transmission and the corresponding transmission energy consumption. Hence, it enables devices to simultaneously optimize transmission success rate and energy efficiency in a fully distributed manner. However, although UCB1-tuned based method is effective under stationary conditions, it suffers from slow adaptation in dynamic environments due to its strong reliance on historical observations. To address this limitation, we integrate the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC) to our proposed method. SIC is adopted because it enables low-cost detection of changes in the communication environment, making it suitable for implementation on resource-constrained LoRa EDs. When a change is detected by SIC, the learning history of UCB1-tuned is reset, allowing rapid re-learning under the new conditions. Experimental results using real LoRa devices demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior transmission success rate, energy efficiency, and adaptability compared with the conventional UCB1-tuned algorithm without SIC.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Recursive Training Loops in LLMs: How training data properties modulate distribution shift in generated data?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03814v6)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in the creation of online content, creating feedback loops as subsequent generations of models will be trained on this synthetic data. Such loops were shown to lead to distribution shifts - models misrepresenting the true underlying distributions of human data (also called model collapse). However, how human data properties affect such shifts remains poorly understood. In this paper, we provide the first empirical examination of the effect of such properties on the outcome of recursive training. We first confirm that using different human datasets leads to distribution shifts of different magnitudes. Through exhaustive manipulation of dataset properties combined with regression analyses, we then identify a set of properties predicting distribution shift magnitudes. Lexical diversity is found to amplify these shifts, while semantic diversity and data quality mitigate them. Furthermore, we find that these influences are highly modular: data scrapped from a given internet domain has little influence on the content generated for another domain. Finally, experiments on political bias reveal that human data properties affect whether the initial bias will be amplified or reduced. Overall, our results portray a novel view, where different parts of internet may undergo different types of distribution shift.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 (Oral), Source Code: https://github.com/flowersteam/ce_llms</p></details> |
| **[Improving Multi-turn Task Completion in Task-Oriented Dialog Systems via Prompt Chaining and Fine-Grained Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13298v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Task-oriented dialog (TOD) systems facilitate users in accomplishing complex, multi-turn tasks through natural language. While instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on a range of single-turn NLP tasks, they often struggle with reliable multi-turn task completion in TOD settings, particularly when generating API calls required to interact with external systems. To address this, we introduce RealTOD, a novel framework that improves LLM-based TOD systems through (1) prompt chaining and (2) fine-grained feedback. Prompt chaining enables zero-shot generalization to new domains by automatically synthesizing a schema-aligned in-context example for the target task. Fine-grained feedback verifies each generated API call against the domain schema, identifies specific errors, and provides targeted correction prompts. To evaluate task completion reliability, we introduce full API Call Accuracy as a robust metric, along with detailed sub-metrics to capture common failure modes. We conduct extensive experiments on the SGD and BiTOD benchmarks using four LLMs. RealTOD improves Full API accuracy, surpassing state-of-the-art AutoTOD by 37.10% on SGD and supervised learning-based baseline SimpleTOD by 10.32% on BiTOD. Human evaluations further confirm that LLMs integrated with RealTOD achieve superior task completion, fluency, and informativeness compared to existing methods.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites promotes cooperation in phenotypically diverse populations with tag-mediated interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22077v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Habitat loss and fragmentation have often been viewed as major threats to species interaction and global biodiversity conservation. However, habitat degradation can also give rise to positive ecological and behavioral responses, challenging the notion that its consequences are entirely detrimental. While controlling for the degree of total habitat loss, we studied the influence of habitat fragmentation and phenotypic diversity on the evolution of tag-based cooperation in structured populations with multiple strategies. We developed a spatially explicit agent-based model with empty sites in which phenotypically diverse artificial decision makers engaged into pairwise Snowdrift-game interactions and imitated strategies of their opponent co-players. We systematically varied the number of phenotypic features in the population, the clustering degree of empty sites unsuitable for habitation, as well as the cost-to-benefit ratio $r$, and we measured the resulting equilibrium densities of conditional and unconditional strategies. Our Monte Carlo simulations revealed a complex interplay between the three investigated factors, such that higher phenotypic diversity in combination with lower $r$ and low to intermediate clustering degrees of empty sites markedly suppressed ethnocentric cooperation but simultaneously boosted unconditional, pure altruism. This dominance of unconditional cooperation was remarkably robust to variation in the initial conditions, suggesting that heterogeneous fragmentation of empty sites in moderately degraded habitats can function as a potent cooperation-promoting mechanism even in the presence of initially more favorable strategies. Our study showcases anti-fragility of cooperators in spatially fragmented but phenotypically diverse populations, as they were also able to benefit from harsh environmental conditions emerging in sparsely connected habitat remnants.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 11 Figures, 2 Appendices</p></details> |
| **[APTx Neuron: A Unified Trainable Neuron Architecture Integrating Activation and Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14270v6)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose the APTx Neuron, a novel, unified neural computation unit that integrates non-linear activation and linear transformation into a single trainable expression. The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both optimization-efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((α_i + \tanh(β_i x_i)) \cdot γ_i x_i) + δ$, where all parameters $α_i$, $β_i$, $γ_i$, and $δ$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to $96.69\%$ test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and training efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

| **[fMRI-LM: Towards a Universal Foundation Model for Language-Aligned fMRI Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21760v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have enabled unified reasoning across images, audio, and video, but extending such capability to brain imaging remains largely unexplored. Bridging this gap is essential to link neural activity with semantic cognition and to develop cross-modal brain representations. To this end, we present fMRI-LM, a foundational model that bridges functional MRI (fMRI) and language through a three-stage framework. In Stage 1, we learn a neural tokenizer that maps fMRI into discrete tokens embedded in a language-consistent space. In Stage 2, a pretrained LLM is adapted to jointly model fMRI tokens and text, treating brain activity as a sequence that can be temporally predicted and linguistically described. To overcome the lack of natural fMRI-text pairs, we construct a large descriptive corpus that translates diverse imaging-based features into structured textual descriptors, capturing the low-level organization of fMRI signals. In Stage 3, we perform multi-task, multi-paradigm instruction tuning to endow fMRI-LM with high-level semantic understanding, supporting diverse downstream applications. Across various benchmarks, fMRI-LM achieves strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, and adapts efficiently with parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA), establishing a scalable pathway toward a language-aligned, universal model for structural and semantic understanding of fMRI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code are available: https://github.com/yuxiangwei0808/fMRI-LM</p></details> |
| **[Random state comonads encode cellular automata evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22067v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cellular automata (CA) are quintessential ALife and ubiquitous in many studies of collective behaviour and emergence, from morphogenesis to social dynamics and even brain modelling. Recently, there has been an increased interest in formalising CA, theoretically through category theory and practically in terms of a functional programming paradigm. Unfortunately, these remain either in the realm of simple implementations lacking important practical features, or too abstract and conceptually inaccessible to be useful to the ALife community at large. In this paper, we present a brief and accessible introduction to a category-theoretical model of CA computation through a practical implementation in Haskell. We instantiate arrays as comonads with state and random generators, allowing stochastic behaviour not currently supported in other known implementations. We also emphasise the importance of functional implementations for complex systems: thanks to the Curry-Howard-Lambek isomorphism, functional programs facilitate a mapping between simulation, system rules or semantics, and categorical descriptions, which may advance our understanding and development of generalised theories of emergent behaviour. Using this implementation, we show case studies of four famous CA models: first Wolfram's CA in 1D, then Conway's game of life, Greenberg-Hasings excitable cells, and the stochastic Forest Fire model in 2D, and present directions for an extension to N dimensions. Finally, we suggest that the comonadic model can encode arbitrary topologies and propose future directions for a comonadic network.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |
| **[StreamAvatar: Streaming Diffusion Models for Real-Time Interactive Human Avatars](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22065v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time, streaming interactive avatars represent a critical yet challenging goal in digital human research. Although diffusion-based human avatar generation methods achieve remarkable success, their non-causal architecture and high computational costs make them unsuitable for streaming. Moreover, existing interactive approaches are typically limited to head-and-shoulder region, limiting their ability to produce gestures and body motions. To address these challenges, we propose a two-stage autoregressive adaptation and acceleration framework that applies autoregressive distillation and adversarial refinement to adapt a high-fidelity human video diffusion model for real-time, interactive streaming. To ensure long-term stability and consistency, we introduce three key components: a Reference Sink, a Reference-Anchored Positional Re-encoding (RAPR) strategy, and a Consistency-Aware Discriminator. Building on this framework, we develop a one-shot, interactive, human avatar model capable of generating both natural talking and listening behaviors with coherent gestures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing approaches in generation quality, real-time efficiency, and interaction naturalness.

| **[Real-Time Streamable Generative Speech Restoration with Flow Matching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19442v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based generative models have greatly impacted the speech processing field in recent years, exhibiting high speech naturalness and spawning a new research direction. Their application in real-time communication is, however, still lagging behind due to their computation-heavy nature involving multiple calls of large DNNs. Here, we present Stream$.$FM, a frame-causal flow-based generative model with an algorithmic latency of 32 milliseconds (ms) and a total latency of 48 ms, paving the way for generative speech processing in real-time communication. We propose a buffered streaming inference scheme and an optimized DNN architecture, show how learned few-step numerical solvers can boost output quality at a fixed compute budget, explore model weight compression to find favorable points along a compute/quality tradeoff, and contribute a model variant with 24 ms total latency for the speech enhancement task. Our work looks beyond theoretical latencies, showing that high-quality streaming generative speech processing can be realized on consumer GPUs available today. Stream$.$FM can solve a variety of speech processing tasks in a streaming fashion: speech enhancement, dereverberation, codec post-filtering, bandwidth extension, STFT phase retrieval, and Mel vocoding. As we verify through comprehensive evaluations and a MUSHRA listening test, Stream$.$FM establishes a state-of-the-art for generative streaming speech restoration, exhibits only a reasonable reduction in quality compared to a non-streaming variant, and outperforms our recent work (Diffusion Buffer) on generative streaming speech enhancement while operating at a lower latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Toward Secure and Compliant AI: Organizational Standards and Protocols for NLP Model Lifecycle Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22060v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly used in sensitive domains such as healthcare, finance, and government, where they handle large volumes of personal and regulated data. However, these systems introduce distinct risks related to security, privacy, and regulatory compliance that are not fully addressed by existing AI governance frameworks. This paper introduces the Secure and Compliant NLP Lifecycle Management Framework (SC-NLP-LMF), a comprehensive six-phase model designed to ensure the secure operation of NLP systems from development to retirement. The framework, developed through a systematic PRISMA-based review of 45 peer-reviewed and regulatory sources, aligns with leading standards, including NIST AI RMF, ISO/IEC 42001:2023, the EU AI Act, and MITRE ATLAS. It integrates established methods for bias detection, privacy protection (differential privacy, federated learning), secure deployment, explainability, and secure model decommissioning. A healthcare case study illustrates how SC-NLP-LMF detects emerging terminology drift (e.g., COVID-related language) and guides compliant model updates. The framework offers organizations a practical, lifecycle-wide structure for developing, deploying, and maintaining secure and accountable NLP systems in high-risk environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Embedding Based Ad Retrieval with GPU-Powered Feature Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22460v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-scale advertising recommendation systems, retrieval serves as a critical component, aiming to efficiently select a subset of candidate ads relevant to user behaviors from a massive ad inventory for subsequent ranking and recommendation. The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains. This improvement not only validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also provides new practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, they still mainly rely on explicit textual input and do not know the real world behaviors of users. This paper proposes a context-sensitive conversational assistant framework grounded in mobile sensing data. By collecting user behavior and environmental data through smartphones, we abstract these signals into 16 contextual scenarios and translate them into natural language prompts, thus improving the model's understanding of the user's state. We design a structured prompting system to guide the LLM in generating a more personalized and contextually relevant dialogue. This approach integrates mobile sensing with large language models, demonstrating the potential of passive behavioral data in intelligent conversation and offering a viable path toward digital health and personalized interaction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Companion of the 2025 ACM International Joint Conference on Pervasive and Ubiquitous Computing (UbiComp Companion '25), Espoo, Finland</p></details> |

Existing deepfake detection methods often rely on handcrafted forensic cues and complex architectures, achieving strong performance in intra-domain settings but suffering significant degradation when confronted with unseen forgery patterns. In this paper, we propose GenDF, a simple yet effective framework that transfers a powerful large-scale vision model to the deepfake detection task with a compact and neat network design. GenDF incorporates deepfake-specific representation learning to capture discriminative patterns between real and fake facial images, feature space redistribution to mitigate distribution mismatch, and a classification-invariant feature augmentation strategy to enhance generalization without introducing additional trainable parameters. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GenDF achieves state-of-the-art generalization performance in cross-domain and cross-manipulation settings while requiring only 0.28M trainable parameters, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our p...</summary><p>Our paper was accepted by the IEEE Transactions on Multimedia</p></details> |

We consider both percentile-based and predictive-root-based constructions. Theoretical results establish the validity and pertinence of the proposed methods.

| **[Imitating Radiological Scrolling: A Global-Local Attention Model for 3D Chest CT Volumes Multi-Label Anomaly Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20652v6)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid increase in the number of Computed Tomography (CT) scan examinations has created an urgent need for automated tools, such as organ segmentation, anomaly classification, and report generation, to assist radiologists with their growing workload. Multi-label classification of Three-Dimensional (3D) CT scans is a challenging task due to the volumetric nature of the data and the variety of anomalies to be detected. Existing deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, while Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training, posing challenges for practical use. Additionally, these existing methods do not explicitly model the radiologist's navigational behavior while scrolling through CT scan slices, which requires both global context understanding and local detail awareness. In this study, we present CT-Scroll, a novel global-local attention model specifically designed to emulate the scrolling behavior of radiologists during the analysis of 3D CT scans. Our approach is evaluated on two public datasets, demonstrating its efficacy through comprehensive experiments and an ablation study that highlights the contribution of each model component.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Research on a hybrid LSTM-CNN-Attention model for text-based web content classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18475v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents a hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates LSTM, CNN, and an Attention mechanism to enhance the classification of web content based on text. Pretrained GloVe embeddings are used to represent words as dense vectors that preserve semantic similarity. The CNN layer extracts local n-gram patterns and lexical features, while the LSTM layer models long-range dependencies and sequential structure. The integrated Attention mechanism enables the model to focus selectively on the most informative parts of the input sequence. A 5-fold cross-validation setup was used to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed solution. Experimental results show that the hybrid LSTM-CNN-Attention model achieved outstanding performance, with an accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.92, and F1-score of 0.93. These results surpass the performance of baseline models based solely on CNNs, LSTMs, or transformer-based classifiers such as BERT. The combination of neural network components enabled the model to effectively capture both fine-grained text structures and broader semantic context. Furthermore, the use of GloVe embeddings provided an efficient and effective representation of textual data, making the model suitable for integration into systems with real-time or near-real-time requirements. The proposed hybrid architecture demonstrates high effectiveness in text-based web content classification, particularly in tasks requiring both syntactic feature extraction and semantic interpretation. By combining presented mechanisms, the model addresses the limitations of individual architectures and achieves improved generalization. These findings support the broader use of hybrid deep learning approaches in NLP applications, especially where complex, unstructured textual data must be processed and classified with high reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables.

Most research to-date builds on domain-knowledge-based corruption risk indicators of individual contract-level features and some also analyzes contracting network patterns. A critical barrier for supervised machine learning is the absence of confirmed non-corrupt, negative, examples, which makes conventional machine learning inappropriate for this task. Using publicly available data on federally funded procurement in Mexico and company sanction records, this study implements positive-unlabeled (PU) learning algorithms that integrate domain-knowledge-based red flags with network-derived features to identify likely corrupt and fraudulent contracts. The best-performing PU model on average captures 32 percent more known positives and performs on average 2.3 times better than random guessing, substantially outperforming approaches based solely on traditional red flags. The analysis of the Shapley Additive Explanations reveals that network-derived features, particularly those associated with contracts in the network core or suppliers with high eigenvector centrality, are the most important. Traditional red flags further enhance model performance in line with expectations, albeit mainly for contracts awarded through competitive tenders. This methodology can support law enforcement in Mexico, and it can be adapted to other national contexts too.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages of main text with 6 figures and 31 pages of supplementary information</p></details> |

While the squared error loss permits a straightforward decomposition, other loss functions - such as zero-one loss or $L_1$ loss - either fail to sum bias and variance to the expected loss or rely on definitions that lack the essential properties of meaningful bias and variance. Recent research has shown that clean decompositions can be achieved for the broader class of Bregman divergences, with the cross-entropy loss as a special case. However, the necessary and sufficient conditions for these decompositions remain an open question. In this paper, we address this question by studying continuous, nonnegative loss functions that satisfy the identity of indiscernibles (zero loss if and only if the two arguments are identical), under mild regularity conditions. We prove that so-called $g$-Bregman or rho-tau divergences are the only such loss functions that have a clean bias-variance decomposition. A $g$-Bregman divergence can be transformed into a standard Bregman divergence through an invertible change of variables. This makes the squared Mahalanobis distance, up to such a variable transformation, the only symmetric loss function with a clean bias-variance decomposition. Consequently, common metrics such as $0$-$1$ and $L_1$ losses cannot admit a clean bias-variance decomposition, explaining why previous attempts have failed. We also examine the impact of relaxing the restrictions on the loss functions and how this affects our results.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revision based on reviewer feedback and helpful comments from colleagues; improved clarity of exposition, corrected notation conflicts, and fixed minor issues; simplified main proof</p></details> |

| **[Explainable Multimodal Regression via Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22102v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal regression aims to predict a continuous target from heterogeneous input sources and typically relies on fusion strategies such as early or late fusion. However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference. Implementation is available at https://github.com/zhaozhaoma/PIDReg.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://github.com/zhaozhaoma/PIDReg</p></details> |

Among these, the evaluation of natural language understanding (NLU) is particularly critical as it serves as a fundamental criterion for assessing model capabilities. Thus, it is essential to establish benchmarks that enable thorough evaluation and analysis of NLU abilities from diverse perspectives. While the GLUE benchmark has set a standard for evaluating English NLU, similar benchmarks have been developed for other languages, such as CLUE for Chinese, FLUE for French, and JGLUE for Japanese. However, no comparable benchmark currently exists for the Turkish language. To address this gap, we introduce TrGLUE, a comprehensive benchmark encompassing a variety of NLU tasks for Turkish. In addition, we present SentiTurca, a specialized benchmark for sentiment analysis. To support researchers, we also provide fine-tuning and evaluation code for transformer-based models, facilitating the effective use of these benchmarks. TrGLUE comprises Turkish-native corpora curated to mirror the domains and task formulations of GLUE-style evaluations, with labels obtained through a semi-automated pipeline that combines strong LLM-based annotation, cross-model agreement checks, and subsequent human validation. This design prioritizes linguistic naturalness, minimizes direct translation artifacts, and yields a scalable, reproducible workflow. With TrGLUE, our goal is to establish a robust evaluation framework for Turkish NLU, empower researchers with valuable resources, and provide insights into generating high-quality semi-automated datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>under...</summary><p>under review by Springer</p></details> |

The APTx Neuron is derived from the APTx activation function, thereby eliminating the need for separate activation layers and making the architecture both optimization-efficient and elegant. The proposed neuron follows the functional form $y = \sum_{i=1}^{n} ((α_i + \tanh(β_i x_i)) \cdot γ_i x_i) + δ$, where all parameters $α_i$, $β_i$, $γ_i$, and $δ$ are trainable. We validate our APTx Neuron-based architecture on the MNIST dataset, achieving up to $96.69\%$ test accuracy within 11 epochs using approximately 332K trainable parameters. The results highlight the superior expressiveness and training efficiency of the APTx Neuron compared to traditional neurons, pointing toward a new paradigm in unified neuron design and the architectures built upon it.

Their application in real-time communication is, however, still lagging behind due to their computation-heavy nature involving multiple calls of large DNNs. Here, we present Stream$.$FM, a frame-causal flow-based generative model with an algorithmic latency of 32 milliseconds (ms) and a total latency of 48 ms, paving the way for generative speech processing in real-time communication. We propose a buffered streaming inference scheme and an optimized DNN architecture, show how learned few-step numerical solvers can boost output quality at a fixed compute budget, explore model weight compression to find favorable points along a compute/quality tradeoff, and contribute a model variant with 24 ms total latency for the speech enhancement task. Our work looks beyond theoretical latencies, showing that high-quality streaming generative speech processing can be realized on consumer GPUs available today. Stream$.$FM can solve a variety of speech processing tasks in a streaming fashion: speech enhancement, dereverberation, codec post-filtering, bandwidth extension, STFT phase retrieval, and Mel vocoding. As we verify through comprehensive evaluations and a MUSHRA listening test, Stream$.$FM establishes a state-of-the-art for generative streaming speech restoration, exhibits only a reasonable reduction in quality compared to a non-streaming variant, and outperforms our recent work (Diffusion Buffer) on generative streaming speech enhancement while operating at a lower latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[An Efficient Embedding Based Ad Retrieval with GPU-Powered Feature Interaction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22460v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In large-scale advertising recommendation systems, retrieval serves as a critical component, aiming to efficiently select a subset of candidate ads relevant to user behaviors from a massive ad inventory for subsequent ranking and recommendation. The Embedding-Based Retrieval (EBR) methods modeled by the dual-tower network are widely used in the industry to maintain both retrieval efficiency and accuracy. However, the dual-tower model has significant limitations: the embeddings of users and ads interact only at the final inner product computation, resulting in insufficient feature interaction capabilities. Although DNN-based models with both user and ad as input features, allowing for early-stage interaction between these features, are introduced in the ranking stage to mitigate this issue, they are computationally infeasible for the retrieval stage. To bridge this gap, this paper proposes an efficient GPU-based feature interaction for the dual-tower network to significantly improve retrieval accuracy while substantially reducing computational costs. Specifically, we introduce a novel compressed inverted list designed for GPU acceleration, enabling efficient feature interaction computation at scale. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework in the industry to successfully implement Wide and Deep in a retrieval system. We apply this model to the real-world business scenarios in Tencent Advertising, and experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches in offline evaluation and has been successfully deployed to Tencent's advertising recommendation system, delivering significant online performance gains. This improvement not only validates the effectiveness of the proposed method, but also provides new practical guidance for optimizing large-scale ad retrieval systems.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

By compressing the smoothing aperture, the proposed VWS Coarray MUSIC (VWS-CA-MUSIC) and VWS Coarray root-MUSIC (VWS-CA-rMUSIC) algorithms replace part of the perturbed rank-one outer products in the smoothed coarray data with unperturbed low-rank additional terms, increasing the separation between signal and noise subspaces, while preserving the signal subspace span. We also derive the bounds that guarantees identifiability, by limiting the values that can be assumed by the compression parameter. Simulations with sparse geometries reveal significant performance improvements and complexity savings relative to the fixed-window coarray MUSIC method.</p></details> | 2 figures, 5 pages |

Multi-label classification of Three-Dimensional (3D) CT scans is a challenging task due to the volumetric nature of the data and the variety of anomalies to be detected. Existing deep learning methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) struggle to capture long-range dependencies effectively, while Vision Transformers require extensive pre-training, posing challenges for practical use. Additionally, these existing methods do not explicitly model the radiologist's navigational behavior while scrolling through CT scan slices, which requires both global context understanding and local detail awareness. In this study, we present CT-Scroll, a novel global-local attention model specifically designed to emulate the scrolling behavior of radiologists during the analysis of 3D CT scans. Our approach is evaluated on two public datasets, demonstrating its efficacy through comprehensive experiments and an ablation study that highlights the contribution of each model component.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 4 figures.

Pretrained GloVe embeddings are used to represent words as dense vectors that preserve semantic similarity. The CNN layer extracts local n-gram patterns and lexical features, while the LSTM layer models long-range dependencies and sequential structure. The integrated Attention mechanism enables the model to focus selectively on the most informative parts of the input sequence. A 5-fold cross-validation setup was used to assess the robustness and generalizability of the proposed solution. Experimental results show that the hybrid LSTM-CNN-Attention model achieved outstanding performance, with an accuracy of 0.98, precision of 0.94, recall of 0.92, and F1-score of 0.93.

This approach enables the system to simultaneously control the pose of the fabric piece and place it onto the underlying one while applying tension to keep the fabric piece flat. Our transformer-based network incorporates pretrained backbones and a newly introduced Difference Extraction Attention Module (DEAM), which significantly enhances pose difference prediction accuracy. Trained entirely on synthetic images generated using rendering software, the network enables zero-shot deployment in real-world scenarios without requiring prior training on specific fabric textures. Real-world experiments demonstrate that the proposed system accurately aligns fabric pieces with different textures.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 11 figures.

While modern GPUs provide specialised Matrix-Multiply-Accumulate (MMA) units, e.g., Tensor Cores (TC), with extremely high throughput, they target dense operations, making it non-trivial to exploit them for irregular, unstructured graph computations. In particular, fully utilising them for a BFS requires an efficient mapping of the edge operations onto TCs while avoiding redundancy, load imbalance, and synchronisation. We present BLEST, a TC-accelerated framework that reformulates the pull-based BFS pipeline around a bitmap-oriented structure and a carefully engineered execution layout. BLEST introduces Binarised Virtual Slice Sets (BVSS) to enforce warp-level load balancing and to eliminate frontier-oblivious work assignment. To improve both memory efficiency and update locality across diverse graphs, we apply two complementary graph reordering strategies: a compression-oriented ordering for social-like graphs and a bandwidth-reducing ordering for non-social graphs. At the compute level, we develop a batched SpMSpV multiplication pattern that uses the bitwise TC tiles to handle dot products without wasting output entries, thereby reducing the number of required MMA calls. Finally, BLEST combines kernel fusion with a lazy vertex update scheme to reduce host-side synchronisation, mitigate atomic overheads, and improve cache locality. Experiments show that BLEST delivers, on average, $3.58\times$, $4.64\times$ and $4.9\times$ speedup over BerryBees, Gunrock, and GSWITCH, respectively, across a broad set of real-world graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, 3 algorithms, 46 references</p></details> |

However, existing methods often struggle to capture long-range dependencies efficiently and neglect the spectral information. Recently, selective state space models, particularly Mamba, have demonstrated remarkable advantages in capturing long-range dependencies with linear complexity and a selection mechanism. Motivated by their success across various domains, we propose GLADMamba, a novel framework that adapts the selective state space model into UGLAD field. We design a View-Fused Mamba (VFM) module with a Mamba-Transformer-style architecture to efficiently fuse information from different graph views with a selective state mechanism. We also design a Spectrum-Guided Mamba (SGM) module with a Mamba-Transformer-style architecture to leverage the Rayleigh quotient to guide the embedding refinement process, considering the spectral information for UGLAD. GLADMamba can dynamically focus on anomaly-related information while discarding irrelevant information for anomaly detection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to introduce Mamba and explicit spectral information to UGLAD. Extensive experiments on 12 real-world datasets demonstrate that GLADMamba outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving superior performance in UGLAD.

MMCTOP couples schema-guided textualization and input-fidelity validation with modality-aware representation learning, in which domain-specific encoders generate aligned embeddings that are fused by a transformer backbone augmented with a drug-disease-conditioned sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE). This design explicitly supports specialization across therapeutic and design subspaces while maintaining scalable computation through top-k routing. MMCTOP achieves consistent improvements in precision, F1, and AUC over unimodal and multimodal baselines on benchmark datasets, and ablations show that schema-guided textualization and selective expert routing contribute materially to performance and stability. We additionally apply temperature scaling to obtain calibrated probabilities, ensuring reliable risk estimation for downstream decision support. Overall, MMCTOP advances multimodal trial modeling by combining controlled narrative normalization, context-conditioned expert fusion, and operational safeguards aimed at auditability and reproducibility in biomedical informatics.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 3 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Deep learning (DL) has been applied to tackle these challenges; however, many DL approaches overlook computational complexity, especially for floating-point operations (FLOPs), making them unsuitable for resource-limited devices. Transformer-based models have achieved remarkable success in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks, motivating their use in wireless applications. However, their use in indoor localization remains nascent, and directly applying Transformers for indoor localization can be both computationally intensive and exhibit limitations in accuracy. To address these challenges, in this work, we introduce a novel tokenization approach, referred to as Sensor Snapshot Tokenization (SST), which preserves variable-specific representations of power delay profile (PDP) and enhances attention mechanisms by effectively capturing multi-variate correlation. Complementing this, we propose a lightweight Swish-Gated Linear Unit-based Transformer (L-SwiGLU-T) model, designed to reduce computational complexity without compromising localization accuracy. Together, these contributions mitigate the computational burden and dependency on large datasets, making Transformer models more efficient and suitable for resource-constrained scenarios. Experimental results on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that SST and L-SwiGLU-T achieve substantial accuracy and efficiency gains, outperforming larger Transformer and CNN baselines by over 40% while using significantly fewer FLOPs and training samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted at IEEE Transactions on Machine Learning in Communications and Networking</p></details> |

Existing deep-unfolding methods for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) mirror only the slow component-relying on heavy pre-training with many unfolding stages-yet they lack the rapid adaptation needed to handle new optical configurations. As a result, they falter on out-of-distribution cameras, especially in bespoke spectral setups unseen during training. This depth also incurs heavy computation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we introduce SlowFast-SCI, a dual-speed framework seamlessly integrated into any deep unfolding network beyond SCI systems. During slow learning, we pre-train or reuse a priors-based backbone and distill it via imaging guidance into a compact fast-unfolding model. In the fast learning stage, lightweight adaptation modules are embedded within each block and trained self-supervised at test time via a dual-domain loss-without retraining the backbone. To the best of our knowledge, SlowFast-SCI is the first test-time adaptation-driven deep unfolding framework for efficient, self-adaptive spectral reconstruction. Its dual-stage design unites offline robustness with on-the-fly per-sample calibration-yielding over 70% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, up to 5.79 dB PSNR improvement on out-of-distribution data, preserved cross-domain adaptability, and a 4x faster adaptation speed. In addition, its modularity integrates with any deep-unfolding network, paving the way for self-adaptive, field-deployable imaging and expanded computational imaging modalities.

In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our results validate CellMamba as an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution cell detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>36th ...</summary><p>36th British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC 2025)</p></details> |

Standard Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are state-of-the-art solution for 2D, have a hard time capturing three-dimensional spatial relationships, especially when 75% of tokens are discarded during pre-training. We propose BertsWin, a hybrid architecture combining full BERT-style token masking using Swin Transformer windows, to enhance spatial context learning in 3D during SSL pre-training. Unlike the classic MAE, which processes only visible areas, BertsWin introduces a complete 3D grid of tokens (masked and visible), preserving the spatial topology. And to smooth out the quadratic complexity of ViT, single-level local Swin windows are used. We introduce a structural priority loss function and evaluate the results of cone beam computed tomography of the temporomandibular joints. The subsequent assessment includes TMJ segmentation on 3D CT scans. We demonstrate that the BertsWin architecture, by maintaining a complete three-dimensional spatial topology, inherently accelerates semantic convergence by a factor of 5.8x compared to standard ViT-MAE baselines. Furthermore, when coupled with our proposed GradientConductor optimizer, the full BertsWin framework achieves a 15-fold reduction in training epochs (44 vs 660) required to reach state-of-the-art reconstruction fidelity. Analysis reveals that BertsWin achieves this acceleration without the computational penalty typically associated with dense volumetric processing. At canonical input resolutions, the architecture maintains theoretical FLOP parity with sparse ViT baselines, resulting in a significant net reduction in total computational resources due to faster convergence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/AlevLab-dev/BertsWinMAE and https://github.com/AlevLab-dev/GCond.

This study presents a Modified TSception architecture designed for the robust assessment of driver fatigue using Electroencephalography (EEG). The model introduces a novel hierarchical architecture that surpasses the original TSception by implementing a five-layer temporal refinement strategy to capture multi-scale brain dynamics. A key innovation is the use of Adaptive Average Pooling, which provides the structural flexibility to handle varying EEG input dimensions, and a two - stage fusion mechanism that optimizes the integration of spatiotemporal features for improved stability. When evaluated on the SEED-VIG dataset and compared against established methods - including SVM, Transformer, EEGNet, ConvNeXt, LMDA-Net, and the original TSception - the Modified TSception achieves a comparable accuracy of 83.46% (vs. 83.15% for the original). Critically, the proposed model exhibits a substantially reduced confidence interval (0.24 vs. 0.36), signifying a marked improvement in performance stability. Furthermore, the architecture's generalizability is validated on the STEW mental workload dataset, where it achieves state-of-the-art results with 95.93% and 95.35% accuracy for 2-class and 3-class classification, respectively. These improvements in consistency and cross-task generalizability underscore the effectiveness of the proposed modifications for reliable EEG-based monitoring of drowsiness and mental workload.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 Pag...</summary><p>8 Pages, 3 Figures, 1 Table</p></details> |

However, promptly processing such data using state-of-the-art transformer-based vision foundation models faces significant computational overhead in on-device computing or transmission overhead in cloud computing. In this paper, we present Hyperion, the first cloud-device collaborative framework that enables low-latency inference on Ultra-HD vision data using off-the-shelf vision transformers over dynamic networks. Hyperion addresses the computational and transmission bottleneck of Ultra-HD vision transformers by exploiting the intrinsic property in vision Transformer models. Specifically, Hyperion integrates a collaboration-aware importance scorer that identifies critical regions at the patch level, a dynamic scheduler that adaptively adjusts patch transmission quality to balance latency and accuracy under dynamic network conditions, and a weighted ensembler that fuses edge and cloud results to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion enhances frame processing rate by up to 1.61 times and improves the accuracy by up to 20.2% when compared with state-of-the-art baselines under various network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |

However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text, timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation, augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme. Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT) on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity, significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective evaluations.

However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dreamontage.github.io/DreaMontage/</p></details> |

This capability raises concerns about misuse, including disinformation and content manipulation. Detecting AI-generated text is essential to maintain authenticity and prevent malicious applications. Existing research has addressed detection in multiple languages, but the Bengali language remains largely unexplored. Bengali's rich vocabulary and complex structure make distinguishing human-written and AI-generated text particularly challenging. This study investigates five transformer-based models: XLMRoBERTa-Large, mDeBERTaV3-Base, BanglaBERT-Base, IndicBERT-Base and MultilingualBERT-Base. Zero-shot evaluation shows that all models perform near chance levels (around 50% accuracy) and highlight the need for task-specific fine-tuning. Fine-tuning significantly improves performance, with XLM-RoBERTa, mDeBERTa and MultilingualBERT achieving around 91% on both accuracy and F1-score. IndicBERT demonstrates comparatively weaker performance, indicating limited effectiveness in fine-tuning for this task. This work advances AI-generated text detection in Bengali and establishes a foundation for building robust systems to counter AI-generated content.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in 2025 28th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)</p></details> |

Bengali deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study automatic detection of Bengali audio deepfakes using the BanglaFake dataset. We evaluate zeroshot inference with several pretrained models. These include Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53, Whisper, PANNsCNN14, WavLM and Audio Spectrogram Transformer. Zero-shot results show limited detection ability. The best model, Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53, achieves 53.80% accuracy, 56.60% AUC and 46.20% EER. We then f ine-tune multiple architectures for Bengali deepfake detection. These include Wav2Vec2-Base, LCNN, LCNN-Attention, ResNet18, ViT-B16 and CNN-BiLSTM. Fine-tuned models show strong performance gains. ResNet18 achieves the highest accuracy of 79.17%, F1 score of 79.12%, AUC of 84.37% and EER of 24.35%. Experimental results confirm that fine-tuning significantly improves performance over zero-shot inference. This study provides the first systematic benchmark of Bengali deepfake audio detection.

To tackle this challenge, we introduce FUSE, a hybrid system that combines spectral features extracted through Fast Fourier Transform with semantic features obtained from the CLIP's Vision encoder. The features are fused into a joint representation and trained progressively in two stages. Evaluations on GenImage, WildFake, DiTFake, GPT-ImgEval and Chameleon datasets demonstrate strong generalization across multiple generators. Our FUSE (Stage 1) model demonstrates state-of-the-art results on the Chameleon benchmark. It also attains 91.36% mean accuracy on the GenImage dataset, 88.71% accuracy across all tested generators, and a mean Average Precision of 94.96%. Stage 2 training further improves performance for most generators. Unlike existing methods, which often perform poorly on high-fidelity images in Chameleon, our approach maintains robustness across diverse generators. These findings highlight the benefits of integrating spectral and semantic features for generalized detection of images generated by AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in 2025 28th International Conference on Computer and Information Technology (ICCIT)</p></details> |

To address this, we introduce HiStream, an efficient autoregressive framework that systematically reduces redundancy across three axes: i) Spatial Compression: denoising at low resolution before refining at high resolution with cached features; ii) Temporal Compression: a chunk-by-chunk strategy with a fixed-size anchor cache, ensuring stable inference speed; and iii) Timestep Compression: applying fewer denoising steps to subsequent, cache-conditioned chunks. On 1080p benchmarks, our primary HiStream model (i+ii) achieves state-of-the-art visual quality while demonstrating up to 76.2x faster denoising compared to the Wan2.1 baseline and negligible quality loss. Our faster variant, HiStream+, applies all three optimizations (i+ii+iii), achieving a 107.5x acceleration over the baseline, offering a compelling trade-off between speed and quality, thereby making high-resolution video generation both practical and scalable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://haonanqiu.com/projects/HiStream.html</p></details> |

While these assumptions enable tractable mathematical characterizations, they fail to capture the stringent requirements of some emerging next-generation wireless applications, such as ultra-reliable low latency communication and ultra-massive machine type communication, in which it is required to support a much wider range of features including short-packet communication, extremely low latency, and/or low energy consumption. To better support such applications, it is important to consider finite-blocklength information theory. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of the advances in this field, followed by a discussion on the open questions. Specifically, we commence with the fundamental limits of source coding in the non-asymptotic regime, with a particular focus on lossless and lossy compression in point-to-point~(P2P) and multiterminal cases. Next, we discuss the fundamental limits of channel coding in P2P channels, multiple access channels, and emerging massive access channels. We further introduce recent advances in joint source and channel coding, highlighting its considerable performance advantage over separate source and channel coding in the non-asymptotic regime. In each part, we review various non-asymptotic achievability bounds, converse bounds, and approximations, as well as key ideas behind them, which are essential for providing engineering insights into the design of future wireless communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in Fundamental Research -- Future Mobile Information Networks</p></details> |

| **[Explainable Multimodal Regression via Information Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22102v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal regression aims to predict a continuous target from heterogeneous input sources and typically relies on fusion strategies such as early or late fusion. However, existing methods lack principled tools to disentangle and quantify the individual contributions of each modality and their interactions, limiting the interpretability of multimodal fusion. We propose a novel multimodal regression framework grounded in Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes modality-specific representations into unique, redundant, and synergistic components. The basic PID framework is inherently underdetermined. To resolve this, we introduce inductive bias by enforcing Gaussianity in the joint distribution of latent representations and the transformed response variable (after inverse normal transformation), thereby enabling analytical computation of the PID terms. Additionally, we derive a closed-form conditional independence regularizer to promote the isolation of unique information within each modality. Experiments on six real-world datasets, including a case study on large-scale brain age prediction from multimodal neuroimaging data, demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both predictive accuracy and interpretability, while also enabling informed modality selection for efficient inference.

While experimental techniques like spatial transcriptomics now enable high-resolution mapping of tissue organization across space and time, current methods that model cellular evolution operate at the single-cell level, overlooking the coordinated development of cellular states in a tissue. We introduce NicheFlow, a flow-based generative model that infers the temporal trajectory of cellular microenvironments across sequential spatial slides. By representing local cell neighborhoods as point clouds, NicheFlow jointly models the evolution of cell states and spatial coordinates using optimal transport and Variational Flow Matching. Our approach successfully recovers both global spatial architecture and local microenvironment composition across diverse spatiotemporal datasets, from embryonic to brain development.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 15 figures, to appear in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Releasing intermediate representations such as CSI spectrograms can inadvertently expose sensitive information, including user identity, location, and membership, motivating formal privacy guarantees. In this paper, we study differentially private (DP) feature release for wireless sensing and propose an adaptive privacy budget allocation mechanism tailored to the highly non-uniform structure of CSI time-frequency representations. Our pipeline converts CSI to bounded spectrogram features, applies sensitivity control via clipping, estimates task-relevant importance over the time-frequency plane, and allocates a global privacy budget across spectrogram blocks before injecting calibrated Gaussian noise. Experiments on multi-user activity sensing (WiMANS), multi-person 3D pose estimation (Person-in-WiFi 3D), and respiration monitoring (Resp-CSI) show that adaptive allocation consistently improves the privacy-utility frontier over uniform perturbation under the same privacy budget. Our method yields higher accuracy and lower error while substantially reducing empirical leakage in identity and membership inference attacks.</p></details> | 19pages,4figures |

Their application in real-time communication is, however, still lagging behind due to their computation-heavy nature involving multiple calls of large DNNs. Here, we present Stream$.$FM, a frame-causal flow-based generative model with an algorithmic latency of 32 milliseconds (ms) and a total latency of 48 ms, paving the way for generative speech processing in real-time communication. We propose a buffered streaming inference scheme and an optimized DNN architecture, show how learned few-step numerical solvers can boost output quality at a fixed compute budget, explore model weight compression to find favorable points along a compute/quality tradeoff, and contribute a model variant with 24 ms total latency for the speech enhancement task. Our work looks beyond theoretical latencies, showing that high-quality streaming generative speech processing can be realized on consumer GPUs available today. Stream$.$FM can solve a variety of speech processing tasks in a streaming fashion: speech enhancement, dereverberation, codec post-filtering, bandwidth extension, STFT phase retrieval, and Mel vocoding. As we verify through comprehensive evaluations and a MUSHRA listening test, Stream$.$FM establishes a state-of-the-art for generative streaming speech restoration, exhibits only a reasonable reduction in quality compared to a non-streaming variant, and outperforms our recent work (Diffusion Buffer) on generative streaming speech enhancement while operating at a lower latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research. 30 pages, 16 figures</p></details> |
| **[SWE-RM: Execution-free Feedback For Software Engineering Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21919v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Execution-based feedback like unit testing is widely used in the development of coding agents through test-time scaling (TTS) and reinforcement learning (RL). This paradigm requires scalable and reliable collection of unit test cases to provide accurate feedback, and the resulting feedback is often sparse and cannot effectively distinguish between trajectories that are both successful or both unsuccessful. In contrast, execution-free feedback from reward models can provide more fine-grained signals without depending on unit test cases. Despite this potential, execution-free feedback for realistic software engineering (SWE) agents remains underexplored. Aiming to develop versatile reward models that are effective across TTS and RL, however, we observe that two verifiers with nearly identical TTS performance can nevertheless yield very different results in RL. Intuitively, TTS primarily reflects the model's ability to select the best trajectory, but this ability does not necessarily generalize to RL. To address this limitation, we identify two additional aspects that are crucial for RL training: classification accuracy and calibration. We then conduct comprehensive controlled experiments to investigate how to train a robust reward model that performs well across these metrics. In particular, we analyze the impact of various factors such as training data scale, policy mixtures, and data source composition. Guided by these investigations, we introduce SWE-RM, an accurate and robust reward model adopting a mixture-of-experts architecture with 30B total parameters and 3B activated during inference. SWE-RM substantially improves SWE agents on both TTS and RL performance. For example, it increases the accuracy of Qwen3-Coder-Flash from 51.6% to 62.0%, and Qwen3-Coder-Max from 67.0% to 74.6% on SWE-Bench Verified using TTS, achieving new state-of-the-art performance among open-source models.</p></details> | 21 pages |

However, the verification stage often becomes the dominant computational bottleneck, especially for long-context inputs and mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. Existing sparsification methods are designed primarily for standard token-by-token autoregressive decoding to remove substantial computational redundancy in LLMs. This work systematically adopts different sparse methods on the verification stage of the speculative decoding and identifies structured redundancy across multiple dimensions. Based on these observations, we propose a sparse verification framework that jointly sparsifies attention, FFN, and MoE components during the verification stage to reduce the dominant computation cost. The framework further incorporates an inter-draft token and inter-layer retrieval reuse strategy to further reduce redundant computation without introducing additional training. Extensive experiments across summarization, question answering, and mathematical reasoning datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods achieve favorable efficiency-accuracy trade-offs, while maintaining stable acceptance length.</p></details> | Pre-print |
| **[Graph Drawing Stress Model with Resistance Distances](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21901v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper challenges the convention of using graph-theoretic shortest distance in stress-based graph drawing. We propose a new paradigm based on resistance distance, derived from the graph Laplacian's spectrum, which better captures global graph structure. This approach overcomes theoretical and computational limitations of traditional methods, as resistance distance admits a natural isometric embedding in Euclidean space. Our experiments demonstrate improved neighborhood preservation and cluster faithfulness. We introduce Omega, a linear-time graph drawing algorithm that integrates a fast resistance distance embedding with random node-pair sampling for Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). This comprehensive random sampling strategy, enabled by efficient pre-computation of resistance distance embeddings, is more effective and robust than pivot-based sampling used in prior algorithms, consistently achieving lower and more stable stress values. The algorithm maintains $O(|E|)$ complexity for both weighted and unweighted graphs. Our work establishes a connection between spectral graph theory and stress-based layouts, providing a practical and scalable solution for network visualization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PacificVis 2026 (TVCG Journal Track)</p></details> |

Traditional quantitative methods remain vulnerable to survivorship bias, while many AI-driven approaches struggle with signal integration, reproducibility, and computational efficiency. We introduce MASFIN, a modular multi-agent framework that integrates LLMs with structured financial metrics and unstructured news, while embedding explicit bias-mitigation protocols. The system leverages GPT-4.1-nano for reproducability and cost-efficient inference and generates weekly portfolios of 15-30 equities with allocation weights optimized for short-term performance. In an eight-week evaluation, MASFIN delivered a 7.33% cumulative return, outperforming the S&P 500, NASDAQ-100, and Dow Jones benchmarks in six of eight weeks, albeit with higher volatility. These findings demonstrate the promise of bias-aware, generative AI frameworks for financial forecasting and highlight opportunities for modular multi-agent design to advance practical, transparent, and reproducible approaches in quantitative finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the NeurIPS 2025 Workshop on Generative AI in Finance</p></details> |

However, the auto-regressive generation process of LLMs makes it challenging to model and estimate the end-to-end execution time. Furthermore, existing efficient inference methods based on a fixed key-value (KV) cache eviction ratio struggle to adapt to varying tasks with diverse time budgets, where an improper eviction ratio may lead to incomplete inference or a drop in response performance. In this paper, we propose TimeBill, a novel time-budgeted inference framework for LLMs that balances the inference efficiency and response performance. To be more specific, we propose a fine-grained response length predictor (RLP) and an execution time estimator (ETE) to accurately predict the end-to-end execution time of LLMs. Following this, we develop a time-budgeted efficient inference approach that adaptively adjusts the KV cache eviction ratio based on execution time prediction and the given time budget. Finally, through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the advantages of TimeBill in improving task completion rate and maintaining response performance under various overrun strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[SlowFast-SCI: Slow-Fast Deep Unfolding Learning for Spectral Compressive Imaging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16509v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Humans learn in two complementary ways: a slow, cumulative process that builds broad, general knowledge, and a fast, on-the-fly process that captures specific experiences. Existing deep-unfolding methods for spectral compressive imaging (SCI) mirror only the slow component-relying on heavy pre-training with many unfolding stages-yet they lack the rapid adaptation needed to handle new optical configurations. As a result, they falter on out-of-distribution cameras, especially in bespoke spectral setups unseen during training. This depth also incurs heavy computation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we introduce SlowFast-SCI, a dual-speed framework seamlessly integrated into any deep unfolding network beyond SCI systems. During slow learning, we pre-train or reuse a priors-based backbone and distill it via imaging guidance into a compact fast-unfolding model. In the fast learning stage, lightweight adaptation modules are embedded within each block and trained self-supervised at test time via a dual-domain loss-without retraining the backbone. To the best of our knowledge, SlowFast-SCI is the first test-time adaptation-driven deep unfolding framework for efficient, self-adaptive spectral reconstruction. Its dual-stage design unites offline robustness with on-the-fly per-sample calibration-yielding over 70% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, up to 5.79 dB PSNR improvement on out-of-distribution data, preserved cross-domain adaptability, and a 4x faster adaptation speed. In addition, its modularity integrates with any deep-unfolding network, paving the way for self-adaptive, field-deployable imaging and expanded computational imaging modalities. The models, datasets, and code are available at https://github.com/XuanLu11/SlowFast-SCI.</p></details> | 10 pages |

Runtime safety guardrails, which intercept hazardous actions during task execution, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility. However, existing defenses often rely on static rule filters or prompt-level control, which struggle to address implicit risks arising in dynamic, temporally dependent, and context-rich environments. To address this, we propose RoboSafe, a hybrid reasoning runtime safeguard for embodied agents through executable predicate-based safety logic. RoboSafe integrates two complementary reasoning processes on a Hybrid Long-Short Safety Memory. We first propose a Backward Reflective Reasoning module that continuously revisits recent trajectories in short-term memory to infer temporal safety predicates and proactively triggers replanning when violations are detected. We then propose a Forward Predictive Reasoning module that anticipates upcoming risks by generating context-aware safety predicates from the long-term safety memory and the agent's multimodal observations. Together, these components form an adaptive, verifiable safety logic that is both interpretable and executable as code. Extensive experiments across multiple agents demonstrate that RoboSafe substantially reduces hazardous actions (-36.8% risk occurrence) compared with leading baselines, while maintaining near-original task performance. Real-world evaluations on physical robotic arms further confirm its practicality. Code will be released upon acceptance.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

To address this limitation, we propose a two-session experimental framework consisting of an offline data acquisition phase and a subsequent online feedback phase for real-time imagined speech decoding. The paradigm employed a four-class Korean-language task, including three imagined speech targets selected according to the participant's daily communicative needs and a resting-state condition, and was evaluated in a single individual with chronic anomic aphasia. Within this framework, we introduce a lightweight diffusion-based neural decoding model explicitly optimized for real-time inference, achieved through architectural simplifications such as dimensionality reduction, temporal kernel optimization, group normalization with regularization, and dual early-stopping criteria. In real-time evaluation, the proposed system achieved 65 percent top-1 and 70 percent top-2 accuracy, with the Water class reaching 80 percent top-1 and 100 percent top-2 accuracy. These results demonstrate that real-time-optimized diffusion-based architectures, combined with clinically grounded task design, can support feasible online imagined speech decoding for communication-oriented BCI applications in aphasia.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, Name of Conference: International Conference on Brain-Computer Interface</p></details> |

However, their massive parameter scales and substantial resource demands pose critical challenges for efficient inference on edge devices. These devices are inherently constrained by limited computational power and memory capacity, while bandwidth bottlenecks at the network edge further restrict distributed deployment and real-time responsiveness. Although existing research has explored lightweight optimization techniques to mitigate memory limitations, such approaches often incur significant degradation in model accuracy and performance. To address these challenges, we propose LIME, a collaborative system that enables lossless inference for large models across multiple memory-constrained edge devices under limited network bandwidth. LIME employs an interleaved pipeline parallelism in conjunction with model offloading to dynamically balance computation and communication. Furthermore, a fine-grained offline allocation scheduler and online memory adaptation strategy are introduced to enhance the device's computing and storage resources while minimizing inference latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LIME, deployed on four heterogeneous Nvidia Jetson edge devices for LLaMA3.3-70B-Instruct model inference, achieves 1.7$\times$ and 3.7$\times$ speedups over state-of-the-art baselines under sporadic and bursty request patterns respectively, without compromising model accuracy.</p></details> | 15 pages, 18 figures |

A causal view of explainability is favorable for its ability in uncovering underlying mechanisms and generalizing to new contexts. Based on a family of causal explainability quantities, we develop methods for their estimation and inference. In particular, we construct a one-step correction estimator using semi-parametric efficiency theory, which explicitly leverages the independence structure of variables to reduce the asymptotic variance. For a null hypothesis on the boundary, i.e., zero explainability, we show its equivalence to Fisher's sharp null, which motivates a randomization-based inference procedure. Finally, we illustrate the empirical efficacy of our approach through simulations as well as an immigration experiment dataset, where we investigate how features and their interactions shape public opinion toward admitting immigrants.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose CellMamba, a lightweight and accurate one-stage detector tailored for fine-grained biomedical instance detection. Built upon a VSSD backbone, CellMamba integrates CellMamba Blocks, which couple either NC-Mamba or Multi-Head Self-Attention (MSA) with a novel Triple-Mapping Adaptive Coupling (TMAC) module. TMAC enhances spatial discriminability by splitting channels into two parallel branches, equipped with dual idiosyncratic and one consensus attention map, adaptively fused to preserve local sensitivity and global consistency. Furthermore, we design an Adaptive Mamba Head that fuses multi-scale features via learnable weights for robust detection under varying object sizes. Extensive experiments on two public datasets-CoNSeP and CytoDArk0-demonstrate that CellMamba outperforms both CNN-based, Transformer-based, and Mamba-based baselines in accuracy, while significantly reducing model size and inference latency. Our results validate CellMamba as an efficient and effective solution for high-resolution cell detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>36th ...</summary><p>36th British Machine Vision Conference (BMVC 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Assessing the Effectiveness of Membership Inference on Generative Music](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21762v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI systems are quickly improving, now able to produce believable output in several modalities including images, text, and audio. However, this fast development has prompted increased scrutiny concerning user privacy and the use of copyrighted works in training. A recent attack on machine-learning models called membership inference lies at the crossroads of these two concerns. The attack is given as input a set of records and a trained model and seeks to identify which of those records may have been used to train the model. On one hand, this attack can be used to identify user data used to train a model, which may violate their privacy especially in sensitive applications such as models trained on medical data. On the other hand, this attack can be used by rights-holders as evidence that a company used their works without permission to train a model. Remarkably, it appears that no work has studied the effect of membership inference attacks (MIA) on generative music. Given that the music industry is worth billions of dollars and artists would stand to gain from being able to determine if their works were being used without permission, we believe this is a pressing issue to study. As such, in this work we begin a preliminary study into whether MIAs are effective on generative music. We study the effect of several existing attacks on MuseGAN, a popular and influential generative music model. Similar to prior work on generative audio MIAs, our findings suggest that music data is fairly resilient to known membership inference techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Unlike in Gaussian likelihoods, inference is considerably encumbered by the inability to analytically integrate out the random effects and reduce the dimension of the parameter space. Iterative estimation algorithms struggle to converge due to the presence of weakly identified parameters. We devise Bayesian inference using predictive stacking that assimilates inference from analytically tractable conditional posterior distributions. We achieve this by expanding upon the Diaconis-Ylvisaker family of conjugate priors and exploiting generalised conjugate multivariate (GCM) distribution theory for exponential families, which enables exact sampling from analytically available posterior distributions conditional upon some process parameters. Subsequently, we assimilate inference over a range of values of these parameters using Bayesian predictive stacking. We evaluate inferential performance on simulated data, compare with full Bayesian inference using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and apply our method to analyse spatially-temporally referenced avian count data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey database.</p></details> | 41 pages, 9 figures |

Estimating their local characteristics (particularly the jump rate) is an important yet challenging task. In recent years, non-parametric methods for jump rate inference have been developed, but these approaches often rely on distinct theoretical frameworks, complicating direct comparisons. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to standardize and consolidate state-of-the-art approaches. We establish new results on consistency and asymptotic normality within this framework, enabling rigorous theoretical comparisons of convergence rates and asymptotic variances. Notably, we demonstrate that no single method uniformly outperforms the others, even within the same model. These theoretical insights are validated through numerical simulations using a representative PDMP application: the TCP model. Furthermore, we extend the comparison to real-world data, focusing on cell growth and division dynamics in Escherichia coli. This work enhances the theoretical understanding of PDMP inference while offering practical insights into the relative strengths and limitations of existing methods.</p></details> | 40 pages |

However, promptly processing such data using state-of-the-art transformer-based vision foundation models faces significant computational overhead in on-device computing or transmission overhead in cloud computing. In this paper, we present Hyperion, the first cloud-device collaborative framework that enables low-latency inference on Ultra-HD vision data using off-the-shelf vision transformers over dynamic networks. Hyperion addresses the computational and transmission bottleneck of Ultra-HD vision transformers by exploiting the intrinsic property in vision Transformer models. Specifically, Hyperion integrates a collaboration-aware importance scorer that identifies critical regions at the patch level, a dynamic scheduler that adaptively adjusts patch transmission quality to balance latency and accuracy under dynamic network conditions, and a weighted ensembler that fuses edge and cloud results to improve accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that Hyperion enhances frame processing rate by up to 1.61 times and improves the accuracy by up to 20.2% when compared with state-of-the-art baselines under various network environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE INFOCOM 2026</p></details> |

However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text, timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation, augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme. Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT) on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity, significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective evaluations.

However, its practical realization is often hindered by prohibitive costs and complex real-world constraints. Although emerging video generation models offer a virtual alternative, existing approaches typically rely on naive clip concatenation, which frequently fails to maintain visual smoothness and temporal coherence. In this paper, we introduce DreaMontage, a comprehensive framework designed for arbitrary frame-guided generation, capable of synthesizing seamless, expressive, and long-duration one-shot videos from diverse user-provided inputs. To achieve this, we address the challenge through three primary dimensions. (i) We integrate a lightweight intermediate-conditioning mechanism into the DiT architecture. By employing an Adaptive Tuning strategy that effectively leverages base training data, we unlock robust arbitrary-frame control capabilities. (ii) To enhance visual fidelity and cinematic expressiveness, we curate a high-quality dataset and implement a Visual Expression SFT stage. In addressing critical issues such as subject motion rationality and transition smoothness, we apply a Tailored DPO scheme, which significantly improves the success rate and usability of the generated content. (iii) To facilitate the production of extended sequences, we design a Segment-wise Auto-Regressive (SAR) inference strategy that operates in a memory-efficient manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves visually striking and seamlessly coherent one-shot effects while maintaining computational efficiency, empowering users to transform fragmented visual materials into vivid, cohesive one-shot cinematic experiences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://dreamontage.github.io/DreaMontage/</p></details> |

However, LLM inference is computation intensive and memory intensive, and improper parameter configuration at LLM platforms may exacerbate the inference time. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LLM output token distribution on the inference queueing delay, where the max-token clipping and the batched inference are considered. By formulating an M/G/1 model, we observe that enforcing a maximum output token limit on a very small fraction of inference requests can significantly reduce the queueing delay, and our model facilitates the selection of the optimal limit. For the batch inference, we model the service process as a bulk queue in which the batch processing time is affected by the batch size and the maximum token size inside this batch jointly. The queueing delays of the batching of all buffered requests (dynamic batching), the batching of constant number of requests (fixed batching), and the batching without intra-batch waiting (elastic batching) are derived. Experimental results show that our mathematical models coincide with the event-driven simulations well.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Bengali deepfake detection remains largely unexplored. In this work, we study automatic detection of Bengali audio deepfakes using the BanglaFake dataset. We evaluate zeroshot inference with several pretrained models. These include Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53, Whisper, PANNsCNN14, WavLM and Audio Spectrogram Transformer. Zero-shot results show limited detection ability. The best model, Wav2Vec2-XLSR-53, achieves 53.80% accuracy, 56.60% AUC and 46.20% EER. We then f ine-tune multiple architectures for Bengali deepfake detection. These include Wav2Vec2-Base, LCNN, LCNN-Attention, ResNet18, ViT-B16 and CNN-BiLSTM. Fine-tuned models show strong performance gains. ResNet18 achieves the highest accuracy of 79.17%, F1 score of 79.12%, AUC of 84.37% and EER of 24.35%. Experimental results confirm that fine-tuning significantly improves performance over zero-shot inference. This study provides the first systematic benchmark of Bengali deepfake audio detection.

While Processing-in-Memory (PIM) is a promising accelerator, we identify that it suffers from critical inefficiencies when scaled to long contexts: severe channel underutilization, performance-limiting I/O bottlenecks, and massive memory waste from static KV cache management. In this work, we propose PIMphony, a PIM orchestrator that systematically resolves these issues with three co-designed techniques. First, Token-Centric PIM Partitioning (TCP) ensures high channel utilization regardless of batch size. Second, Dynamic PIM Command Scheduling (DCS) mitigates the I/O bottleneck by overlapping data movement and computation. Finally, a Dynamic PIM Access (DPA) controller enables dynamic memory management to eliminate static memory waste. Implemented via an MLIR-based compiler and evaluated on a cycle-accurate simulator, PIMphony significantly improves throughput for long-context LLM inference (up to 72B parameters and 1M context length). Our evaluations show performance boosts of up to 11.3x on PIM-only systems and 8.4x on xPU+PIM systems, enabling more efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world long-context applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 20 figures, Accepted to 2026 IEEE International Symposium on High-Performance Computer Architecture</p></details> |

Despite decades of advancements, its widespread clinical adoption remains constrained by prolonged scan times and heterogeneity across medical environments. This underscores the urgent need for a generalist reconstruction foundation model for ultra-fast CMR imaging, one capable of adapting across diverse imaging scenarios and serving as the essential substrate for all downstream analyses. To enable this goal, we curate MMCMR-427K, the largest and most comprehensive multimodal CMR k-space database to date, comprising 427,465 multi-coil k-space data paired with structured metadata across 13 international centers, 12 CMR modalities, 15 scanners, and 17 CVD categories in populations across three continents. Building on this unprecedented resource, we introduce CardioMM, a generalist reconstruction foundation model capable of dynamically adapting to heterogeneous fast CMR imaging scenarios. CardioMM unifies semantic contextual understanding with physics-informed data consistency to deliver robust reconstructions across varied scanners, protocols, and patient presentations. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that CardioMM achieves state-of-the-art performance in the internal centers and exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to unseen external settings. Even at imaging acceleration up to 24x, CardioMM reliably preserves key cardiac phenotypes, quantitative myocardial biomarkers, and diagnostic image quality, enabling a substantial increase in CMR examination throughput without compromising clinical integrity.

We derive a master equation from three independent economic foundations -- heterogeneous agent aggregation, market equilibrium, and cost minimization -- establishing that the framework rests on fundamental principles rather than ad hoc specifications. The framework nests conventional econometric models -- autoregressive specifications, spatial autoregressive models, and network treatment effect models -- as special cases, providing a bridge between discrete and continuous methods. A key theoretical result shows that the spatial-network interaction coefficient equals the mutual information between geographic and network coordinates, providing a parameter-free measure of channel complementarity. The Feynman-Kac representation characterizes treatment effects as accumulated policy exposure along stochastic paths representing economic linkages, connecting the continuous framework to event study methodology. The no-spillover case emerges as a testable restriction, creating a one-sided risk profile where correct inference is maintained regardless of whether spillovers exist. Monte Carlo simulations confirm that conventional estimators exhibit 25-38% bias when spillovers are present, while our estimator maintains correct inference across all configurations including the no-spillover case.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added explanation on the relationship between conventional and continuous methods</p></details> |

Most existing methods aim to boost classification accuracy by enriching the extracted features with discriminative part-level details. However, they often overlook the fact that the set of support samples acts as a confounding variable, which hampers the FS-FGVC performance by introducing biased data distribution and misguiding the extraction of discriminative features. To address this issue, we propose a new causal FS-FGVC (CausalFSFG) approach inspired by causal inference for addressing biased data distributions through causal intervention. Specifically, based on the structural causal model (SCM), we argue that FS-FGVC infers the subcategories (i.e., effect) from the inputs (i.e., cause), whereas both the few-shot condition disturbance and the inherent fine-grained nature (i.e., large intra-class variance and small inter-class variance) lead to unobservable variables that bring spurious correlations, compromising the final classification performance. To further eliminate the spurious correlations, our CausalFSFG approach incorporates two key components: (1) Interventional multi-scale encoder (IMSE) conducts sample-level interventions, (2) Interventional masked feature reconstruction (IMFR) conducts feature-level interventions, which together reveal real causalities from inputs to subcategories. Extensive experiments and thorough analyses on the widely-used public datasets, including CUB-200-2011, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, demonstrate that our CausalFSFG achieves new state-of-the-art performance. The code is available at https://github.com/PKU-ICST-MIPL/CausalFSFG_TMM.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, accepted by IEEE TMM</p></details> |

As a result, the model must simultaneously represent the global structure of the distribution and its fine-scale local variations, which becomes difficult when these scales are strongly mismatched. This issue arises both in natural images, where coarse manifold-level structure and fine textures coexist, and in low-dimensional distributions with highly concentrated local structure. To address this issue, we propose Residual Prior Diffusion (RPD), a two-stage framework in which a coarse prior model first captures the large-scale structure of the data distribution, and a diffusion model is then trained to represent the residual between the prior and the target data distribution. We formulate RPD as an explicit probabilistic model with a tractable evidence lower bound, whose optimization reduces to the familiar objectives of noise prediction or velocity prediction. We further introduce auxiliary variables that leverage information from the prior model and theoretically analyze how they reduce the difficulty of the prediction problem in RPD. Experiments on synthetic datasets with fine-grained local structure show that standard diffusion models fail to capture local details, whereas RPD accurately captures fine-scale detail while preserving the large-scale structure of the distribution. On natural image generation tasks, RPD achieved generation quality that matched or exceeded that of representative diffusion-based baselines and it maintained strong performance even with a small number of inference steps.</p></details> | 40 pages |

Existing type inference tools have achieved advances in type inference within isolated code snippets. However, repository-level type inference remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the complex inter-procedural dependencies that are difficult to model and resolve. To fill this gap, we present \methodName, a novel approach based on LLMs that achieves repository-level type inference through the co-evolution of types and dependencies. \methodName~constructs an Entity Dependency Graph (EDG) to model the objects and type dependencies across the repository. During the inference process, it iteratively refines types and dependencies in EDG for accurate type inference. Our key innovations are: (1) an EDG model designed to capture repository-level type dependencies; (2) an iterative type inference approach where types and dependencies co-evolve in each iteration; and (3) a type-checker-in-the-loop strategy that validates and corrects inferences on-the-fly, thereby reducing error propagation. When evaluated on 12 complex Python repositories, \methodName~significantly outperformed prior works, achieving a \textit{TypeSim} score of 0.89 and a \textit{TypeExact} score of 0.84, representing a 27\% and 40\% relative improvement over the strongest baseline. More importantly, \methodName~removed new type errors introduced by the tool by 92.7\%. This demonstrates a significant leap towards automated, reliable type annotation for real-world Python development.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2026 |

In this short paper, we the idea of automated algorithm discovery in the signal processing context through meta-learning tools such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS). Specifically, we examine the Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) and its accelerated Fast ISTA (FISTA) variant as candidates for algorithm rediscovery. We develop a meta-learning framework which is capable of rediscovering (several key elements of) the two aforementioned algorithms when given a search space of over 50,000 variables. We then show how our framework can apply to various data distributions and algorithms besides ISTA/FISTA.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented at the 59th Asilomar Conference on Signals, Systems, and Computers</p></details> |
| **[Vision Transformers are Circulant Attention Learners](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21542v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the advancement of vision Transformers. However, its quadratic complexity imposes a heavy computational burden in high-resolution scenarios, restricting the practical application. Previous methods attempt to mitigate this issue by introducing handcrafted patterns such as locality or sparsity, which inevitably compromise model capacity. In this paper, we present a novel attention paradigm termed \textbf{Circulant Attention} by exploiting the inherent efficient pattern of self-attention. Specifically, we first identify that the self-attention matrix in vision Transformers often approximates the Block Circulant matrix with Circulant Blocks (BCCB), a kind of structured matrix whose multiplication with other matrices can be performed in $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ time. Leveraging this interesting pattern, we explicitly model the attention map as its nearest BCCB matrix and propose an efficient computation algorithm for fast calculation. The resulting approach closely mirrors vanilla self-attention, differing only in its use of BCCB matrices. Since our design is inspired by the inherent efficient paradigm, it not only delivers $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ computation complexity, but also largely maintains the capacity of standard self-attention. Extensive experiments on diverse visual tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, establishing circulant attention as a promising alternative to self-attention for vision Transformer architectures.
