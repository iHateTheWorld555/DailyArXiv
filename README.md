| **[Protein Autoregressive Modeling via Multiscale Structure Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04883v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ByteD...</summary><p>ByteDance Seed Tech Report; Page: https://par-protein.github.io/</p></details> |

Existing soft-constraint methods achieve faster computation, but either (1) decouple spatial and temporal optimization or (2) restrict the search space. To overcome these limitations, we introduce MIGHTY, a Hermite spline-based planner that performs spatiotemporal optimization while fully leveraging the continuous search space of a spline. In simulation, MIGHTY achieves a 9.3% reduction in computation time and a 13.1% reduction in travel time over state-of-the-art baselines, with a 100% success rate. In hardware, MIGHTY completes multiple high-speed flights up to 6.7 m/s in a cluttered static environment and long-duration flights with dynamically added obstacles.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |
| **[CoWTracker: Tracking by Warping instead of Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04877v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from video analysis to robotic manipulation. State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: cowtracker.github.io</p></details> |
| **[Subliminal Effects in Your Data: A General Mechanism via Log-Linearity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04863v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training modern large language models (LLMs) has become a veritable smorgasbord of algorithms and datasets designed to elicit particular behaviors, making it critical to develop techniques to understand the effects of datasets on the model's properties. This is exacerbated by recent experiments that show datasets can transmit signals that are not directly observable from individual datapoints, posing a conceptual challenge for dataset-centric understandings of LLM training and suggesting a missing fundamental account of such phenomena. Towards understanding such effects, inspired by recent work on the linear structure of LLMs, we uncover a general mechanism through which hidden subtexts can arise in generic datasets. We introduce Logit-Linear-Selection (LLS), a method that prescribes how to select subsets of a generic preference dataset to elicit a wide range of hidden effects. We apply LLS to discover subsets of real-world datasets so that models trained on them exhibit behaviors ranging from having specific preferences, to responding to prompts in a different language not present in the dataset, to taking on a different persona. Crucially, the effect persists for the selected subset, across models with varying architectures, supporting its generality and universality.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/ishaqadenali/logit-linear-selection</p></details> |
| **[Capacity Bounds on Doppler OFDM Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04862v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems experience significant Doppler effects due to high mobility. While Doppler shifts can be largely compensated, residual frequency uncertainty induces a structured form of channel uncertainty that can limit achievable rates. We model this effect using a block-fading channel of the form $ \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{F} + s \mathbf{G} $, where $s$ is an unknown scalar random parameter. We first study this model in a general $N\times N$ MIMO setting. For this channel, we derive achievable rate lower bounds based on explicit transmission schemes and capacity upper bounds using a duality approach. We study Gaussian signaling and propose a practical superposition scheme with subspace alignment (SN) and successive interference cancellation, where a coarse-layer stream serves as an implicit pilot for decoding refined-layer data. We characterize asymptotic capacity in the near-coherent and high-SNR regimes, and show via Doppler-OFDM simulations that the proposed SN scheme achieves near-optimal rates with low complexity.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, submitted to ISIT 2026</p></details> |
| **[From Evaluation to Design: Using Potential Energy Surface Smoothness Metrics to Guide Machine Learning Interatomic Potential Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04861v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) sometimes fail to reproduce the physical smoothness of the quantum potential energy surface (PES), leading to erroneous behavior in downstream simulations that standard energy and force regression evaluations can miss. Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages main text, 10 pages reference & appendix, 8 figures</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Prediction-based Interventions with Human Decision Makers In Mind](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05704v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated decision systems (ADS) are broadly deployed to inform and support human decision-making across a wide range of consequential settings. However, various context-specific details complicate the goal of establishing meaningful experimental evaluations for prediction-based interventions. Notably, current experiment designs rely on simplifying assumptions about human decision making in order to derive causal estimates. In reality, specific experimental design decisions may induce cognitive biases in human decision makers, which could then significantly alter the observed effect sizes of the prediction intervention. In this paper, we formalize and investigate various models of human decision-making in the presence of a predictive model aid. We show that each of these behavioural models produces dependencies across decision subjects and results in the violation of existing assumptions, with consequences for treatment effect estimation. This work aims to further advance the scientific validity of intervention-based evaluation schemes for the assessment of ADS deployments.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be presented at AISTATS 2025</p></details> |
| **[CoT is Not the Chain of Truth: An Empirical Internal Analysis of Reasoning LLMs for Fake News Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04856v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From generating headlines to fabricating news, the Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically assessed by their final outputs, under the safety assumption that a refusal response signifies safe reasoning throughout the entire process. Challenging this assumption, our study reveals that during fake news generation, even when a model rejects a harmful request, its Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning may still internally contain and propagate unsafe narratives. To analyze this phenomenon, we introduce a unified safety-analysis framework that systematically deconstructs CoT generation across model layers and evaluates the role of individual attention heads through Jacobian-based spectral metrics. Within this framework, we introduce three interpretable measures: stability, geometry, and energy to quantify how specific attention heads respond or embed deceptive reasoning patterns. Extensive experiments on multiple reasoning-oriented LLMs show that the generation risk rise significantly when the thinking mode is activated, where the critical routing decisions concentrated in only a few contiguous mid-depth layers. By precisely identifying the attention heads responsible for this divergence, our work challenges the assumption that refusal implies safety and provides a new understanding perspective for mitigating latent reasoning risks.</p></details> | 28 pages, 35 figures |
| **[Comparing statistical and deep learning techniques for parameter estimation of continuous-time stochastic differentiable equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03980v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic differential equations such as the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process have long been used to model realworld probablistic events such as stock prices and temperature fluctuations. While statistical methods such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), Kalman Filtering, Inverse Variable Method, and more have historically been used to estimate the parameters of stochastic differential equations, the recent explosion of deep learning technology suggests that models such as a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) could produce more precise estimators. We present a series of experiments that compare the estimation accuracy and computational expensiveness of a statistical method (MLE) with a deep learning model (RNN) for the parameters of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Marginal Likelihood Inference for Fitting Dynamical Survival Analysis Models to Epidemic Count Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04855v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stochastic compartmental models are prevalent tools for describing disease spread, but inference under these models is challenging for many types of surveillance data when the marginal likelihood function becomes intractable due to missing information. To address this, we develop a closed-form likelihood for discretely observed incidence count data under the dynamical survival analysis (DSA) paradigm. The method approximates the stochastic population-level hazard by a large population limit while retaining a count-valued stochastic model, and leads to survival analytic inferential strategies that are both computationally efficient and flexible to model generalizations. Through simulation, we show that parameter estimation is competitive with recent exact but computationally expensive likelihood-based methods in partially observed settings. Previous work has shown that the DSA approximation is generalizable, and we show that the inferential developments here also carry over to models featuring individual heterogeneity, such as frailty models. We consider case studies of both Ebola and COVID-19 data on variants of the model, including a network-based epidemic model and a model with distributions over susceptibility, demonstrating its flexibility and practical utility on real, partially observed datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Fixed Frames: Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23174v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs. Code and checkpoints will be released publicly at https://github.com/lucadellalib/dycast.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[PDF-HR: Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04851v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pose and motion priors play a crucial role in humanoid robotics. Although such priors have been widely studied in human motion recovery (HMR) domain with a range of models, their adoption for humanoid robots remains limited, largely due to the scarcity of high-quality humanoid motion data. In this work, we introduce Pose Distance Fields for Humanoid Robots (PDF-HR), a lightweight prior that represents the robot pose distribution as a continuous and differentiable manifold. Given an arbitrary pose, PDF-HR predicts its distance to a large corpus of retargeted robot poses, yielding a smooth measure of pose plausibility that is well suited for optimization and control. PDF-HR can be integrated as a reward shaping term, a regularizer, or a standalone plausibility scorer across diverse pipelines. We evaluate PDF-HR on various humanoid tasks, including single-trajectory motion tracking, general motion tracking, style-based motion mimicry, and general motion retargeting. Experiments show that this plug-and-play prior consistently and substantially strengthens strong baselines. Code and models will be released.</p></details> | <details><summary>\href...</summary><p>\href{https://gaoyukang33.github.io/PDF-HR/}{Project page}</p></details> |
| **[Group-Evolving Agents: Open-Ended Self-Improvement via Experience Sharing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04837v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-ended self-improving agents can autonomously modify their own structural designs to advance their capabilities and overcome the limits of pre-defined architectures, thus reducing reliance on human intervention. We introduce Group-Evolving Agents (GEA), a new paradigm for open-ended self-improvements, which treats a group of agents as the fundamental evolutionary unit, enabling explicit experience sharing and reuse within the group throughout evolution. Unlike existing open-ended self-evolving paradigms that adopt tree-structured evolution, GEA overcomes the limitation of inefficient utilization of exploratory diversity caused by isolated evolutionary branches. We evaluate GEA on challenging coding benchmarks, where it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art self-evolving methods (71.0% vs. 56.7% on SWE-bench Verified, 88.3% vs. 68.3% on Polyglot) and matches or exceeds top human-designed agent frameworks (71.8% and 52.0% on two benchmarks, respectively). Analysis reveals that GEA more effectively converts early-stage exploratory diversity into sustained, long-term progress, achieving stronger performance under the same number of evolved agents. Furthermore, GEA exhibits consistent transferability across different coding models and greater robustness, fixing framework-level bugs in 1.4 iterations on average, versus 5 for self-evolving methods.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[Group-Adaptive Adversarial Learning for Robust Fake News Detection Against Malicious Comments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09712v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online fake news profoundly distorts public judgment and erodes trust in social platforms. While existing detectors achieve competitive performance on benchmark datasets, they remain notably vulnerable to malicious comments designed specifically to induce misclassification. This evolving threat landscape necessitates detection systems that simultaneously prioritize predictive accuracy and structural robustness. However, current detectors often fail to generalize across diverse and novel comment attack patterns. To bridge this gap, we propose AdComment, an adaptive adversarial training framework for robustness enhancement against diverse malicious comments. Based on cognitive psychology, we categorize adversarial comments into Fact Distortion, Logical Confusion, and Emotional Manipulation, and leverage LLMs to synthesize diverse, category-specific perturbations. Central to our framework is an InfoDirichlet Resampling (IDR) mechanism that dynamically adjusts malicious comment proportions during training, thereby steering optimization toward the model's most susceptible regions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on three benchmark datasets, improving the F1 scores by 17.9%, 14.5% and 9.0%, respectively.</p></details> | 10 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Attention Consistency Regularization for Interpretable Early-Exit Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08891v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-exit neural networks enable adaptive inference by allowing predictions at intermediate layers, reducing computational cost. However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regularization. EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models. The proposed method provides more interpretable and consistent explanations across all exit points, making early-exit networks more suitable for explainable AI applications in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 2 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Opinion dynamics under electoral shocks in competitive campaigns](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04829v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a computational framework for modeling opinion dynamics in electoral competitions that combines two realistic features: voter memory and exogenous shocks. The population is represented by a fully-connected network of agents, each holding a binary opinion that reflects support for one of two candidates. First, inspired by the classical voter model, we introduce a memory-dependent opinion update: each agent's probability of adopting a neighbor's stance depends on how many times they agreed with that neighbor in the agent's past $m$ states, promoting inertia and resistance to change. Second, we define an electoral shock as an abrupt external influence acting uniformly over all agents during a finite interval $[t_0, t_0+Δt]$, favoring one candidate by switching opinions with probability $p_s$, representing the impact of extraordinary events such as political scandals, impactful speeches, or sudden news. We explore how the strength and duration of the shock, in conjunction with memory length, influence the transient and stationary properties of the model, as well as the candidates' advantage. Our findings reveal a rich dynamical behavior: memory slows down convergence and enhances system resilience, whereas shocks of sufficient intensity and duration can abruptly realign collective preferences, particularly when occurring close to the election date. Conversely, for long memory lengths or large election horizons, shock effects are dampened or delayed, depending on their timing. These results offer insights into why some sudden political events reshape electoral outcomes while others fade under strong individual inertia. Finally, a qualitative comparison with real electoral shocks reported in opinion polls illustrates how the model captures the competition between voter inertia and abrupt external events observed in actual elections.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 7 figures, to appear in IJMPC</p></details> |
| **[Toward Reliable and Explainable Nail Disease Classification: Leveraging Adversarial Training and Grad-CAM Visualization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04820v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human nail diseases are gradually observed over all age groups, especially among older individuals, often going ignored until they become severe. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 12 figures.

| **[XtraLight-MedMamba for Classification of Neoplastic Tubular Adenomas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04819v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate risk stratification of precancerous polyps during routine colonoscopy screenings is essential for lowering the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC). However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |
| **[X2HDR: HDR Image Generation in a Perceptually Uniform Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04814v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dynamic-range (HDR) formats and displays are becoming increasingly prevalent, yet state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Stable Diffusion and FLUX) typically remain limited to low-dynamic-range (LDR) output due to the lack of large-scale HDR training data. In this work, we show that existing pretrained diffusion models can be easily adapted to HDR generation without retraining from scratch. A key challenge is that HDR images are natively represented in linear RGB, whose intensity and color statistics differ substantially from those of sRGB-encoded LDR images. This gap, however, can be effectively bridged by converting HDR inputs into perceptually uniform encodings (e.g., using PU21 or PQ). Empirically, we find that LDR-pretrained variational autoencoders (VAEs) reconstruct PU21-encoded HDR inputs with fidelity comparable to LDR data, whereas linear RGB inputs cause severe degradations. Motivated by this finding, we describe an efficient adaptation strategy that freezes the VAE and finetunes only the denoiser via low-rank adaptation in a perceptually uniform space. This results in a unified computational method that supports both text-to-HDR synthesis and single-image RAW-to-HDR reconstruction. Experiments demonstrate that our perceptually encoded adaptation consistently improves perceptual fidelity, text-image alignment, and effective dynamic range, relative to previous techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://x2hdr.github.io/, Code: https://github.com/X2HDR/X2HDR</p></details> |
| **[SE-Bench: Benchmarking Self-Evolution with Knowledge Internalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04811v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>True self-evolution requires agents to act as lifelong learners that internalize novel experiences to solve future problems. However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring "Closed-Book Training" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.</p></details> | Under review |
| **[Evolving Afferent Architectures: Biologically-inspired Models for Damage-Avoidance Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04807v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Afferent Learning, a framework that produces Computational Afferent Traces (CATs) as adaptive, internal risk signals for damage-avoidance learning. Inspired by biological systems, the framework uses a two-level architecture: evolutionary optimization (outer loop) discovers afferent sensing architectures that enable effective policy learning, while reinforcement learning (inner loop) trains damage-avoidance policies using these signals. This formalizes afferent sensing as providing an inductive bias for efficient learning: architectures are selected based on their ability to enable effective learning (rather than directly minimizing damage). We provide theoretical convergence guarantees under smoothness and bounded-noise assumptions. We illustrate the general approach in the challenging context of biomechanical digital twins operating over long time horizons (multiple decades of the life-course). Here, we find that CAT-based evolved architectures achieve significantly higher efficiency and better age-robustness than hand-designed baselines, enabling policies that exhibit age-dependent behavioral adaptation (23% reduction in high-risk actions). Ablation studies validate CAT signals, evolution, and predictive discrepancy as essential. We release code and data for reproducibility.</p></details> | 16 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Skin Tokens: A Learned Compact Representation for Unified Autoregressive Rigging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04805v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of generative 3D models has created a critical bottleneck in animation pipelines: rigging. Existing automated methods are fundamentally limited by their approach to skinning, treating it as an ill-posed, high-dimensional regression task that is inefficient to optimize and is typically decoupled from skeleton generation. We posit this is a representation problem and introduce SkinTokens: a learned, compact, and discrete representation for skinning weights. By leveraging an FSQ-CVAE to capture the intrinsic sparsity of skinning, we reframe the task from continuous regression to a more tractable token sequence prediction problem. This representation enables TokenRig, a unified autoregressive framework that models the entire rig as a single sequence of skeletal parameters and SkinTokens, learning the complicated dependencies between skeletons and skin deformations. The unified model is then amenable to a reinforcement learning stage, where tailored geometric and semantic rewards improve generalization to complex, out-of-distribution assets. Quantitatively, the SkinTokens representation leads to a 98%-133% percents improvement in skinning accuracy over state-of-the-art methods, while the full TokenRig framework, refined with RL, enhances bone prediction by 17%-22%. Our work presents a unified, generative approach to rigging that yields higher fidelity and robustness, offering a scalable solution to a long-standing challenge in 3D content creation.</p></details> | 14 pages, 10 figures |
| **[OmniSIFT: Modality-Asymmetric Token Compression for Efficient Omni-modal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04804v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omni-modal Large Language Models (Omni-LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in audio-video understanding tasks. However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released soon</p></details> |
| **[Patterns for a New Generation: AI and Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09696v3)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Design patterns have been used in various fields of inquiry and endeavour to externalize procedural knowledge in a form that supports human reasoning and coordination. In this paper, we show that contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems can also read, generate, and reason with design patterns written in a structured template. We describe an experimental workflow in which patterns function as shared priors for action selection, reflection, and revision in hybrid human/agent settings. Drawing on the Active Inference Framework, we illustrate how patterns can guide agent behavior without fully prescribing it. This provides a proof of concept that pattern-capable agents can be created using now-standard software tools.

| **[VISTA-Bench: Do Vision-Language Models Really Understand Visualized Text as Well as Pure Text?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04802v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved impressive performance in cross-modal understanding across textual and visual inputs, yet existing benchmarks predominantly focus on pure-text queries. In real-world scenarios, language also frequently appears as visualized text embedded in images, raising the question of whether current VLMs handle such input requests comparably. We introduce VISTA-Bench, a systematic benchmark from multimodal perception, reasoning, to unimodal understanding domains. It evaluates visualized text understanding by contrasting pure-text and visualized-text questions under controlled rendering conditions. Extensive evaluation of over 20 representative VLMs reveals a pronounced modality gap: models that perform well on pure-text queries often degrade substantially when equivalent semantic content is presented as visualized text. This gap is further amplified by increased perceptual difficulty, highlighting sensitivity to rendering variations despite unchanged semantics. Overall, VISTA-Bench provides a principled evaluation framework to diagnose this limitation and to guide progress toward more unified language representations across tokenized text and pixels. The source dataset is available at https://github.com/QingAnLiu/VISTA-Bench.</p></details> | 27 pages, 19 figures |

While existing sparse attention solutions have shown promise on bidirectional models, we identify that applying these solutions to AR models leads to considerable performance degradation for two reasons: isolated consideration of chunk generation and insufficient utilization of past informative context. Motivated by these observations, we propose \textsc{Light Forcing}, the \textit{first} sparse attention solution tailored for AR video generation models. It incorporates a \textit{Chunk-Aware Growth} mechanism to quantitatively estimate the contribution of each chunk, which determines their sparsity allocation. This progressive sparsity increase strategy enables the current chunk to inherit prior knowledge in earlier chunks during generation. Additionally, we introduce a \textit{Hierarchical Sparse Attention} to capture informative historical and local context in a coarse-to-fine manner. Such two-level mask selection strategy (\ie, frame and block level) can adaptively handle diverse attention patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing sparse attention in quality (\eg, 84.5 on VBench) and efficiency (\eg, $1.2{\sim}1.3\times$ end-to-end speedup). Combined with FP8 quantization and LightVAE, \textsc{Light Forcing} further achieves a $2.3\times$ speedup and 19.7\,FPS on an RTX~5090 GPU. Code will be released at \href{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}{https://github.com/chengtao-lv/LightForcing}.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schrödinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main:...</summary><p>Main: 13 pages plus references, 11 figures and tables.

However, most deep learning models have an opaque, oracle-like nature making it difficult to interpret and understand their decisions. This problem led to the development of the field known as eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). One method in this field known as Projective Simulation (PS) models a chain-of-thought as a random walk of a particle on a graph with vertices that have concepts attached to them. While this description has various benefits, including the possibility of quantization, it cannot be naturally used to model thoughts that combine several concepts simultaneously. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Multi-Excitation Projective Simulation (mePS), a generalization that considers a chain-of-thought to be a random walk of several particles on a hypergraph. A definition for a dynamic hypergraph is put forward to describe the agent's training history along with applications to AI and hypergraph visualization. An inductive bias inspired by the remarkably successful few-body interaction models used in quantum many-body physics is formalized for our classical mePS framework and employed to tackle the exponential complexity associated with naive implementations of hypergraphs. We prove that our inductive bias reduces the complexity from exponential to polynomial, with the exponent representing the cutoff on how many particles can interact. We numerically apply our method to two toy environments and a more complex scenario modelling the diagnosis of a broken computer. These environments demonstrate the resource savings provided by an appropriate choice of inductive bias, as well as showcasing aspects of interpretability. A quantum model for mePS is also briefly outlined and some future directions for it are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 9 figures; Code repository at https://github.com/MariusKrumm/ManyBodyMEPS.

In transformer based large language models (LLMs), there exist more sophisticated operations beyond activation-weight GEMM. In this paper, we explore how VLP benefits LLMs. First, we generalize VLP for nonlinear approximations, outperforming existing nonlinear approximations in end-to-end LLM accuracy, performance, and efficiency. Our VLP approximation follows a value-centric approach, where important values are assigned with greater accuracy. Second, we optimize VLP for small-batch GEMMs with asymmetric inputs efficiently, which leverages timely LLM optimizations, including weight-only quantization, key-value (KV) cache quantization, and group query attention. Finally, we design a new VLP architecture, Mugi, to encapsulate the innovations above and support full LLM workloads, while providing better performance, efficiency and sustainability. Our experimental results show that Mugi can offer significant improvements on throughput and energy efficiency, up to $45\times$ and $668\times$ for nonlinear softmax operations, and $2.07\times$ and $3.11\times$ for LLMs, and also decrease operational carbon for LLM operation by $1.45\times$ and embodied carbon by $1.48\times$.</p></details> | <details><summary>2026 ...</summary><p>2026 International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems</p></details> |

| **[Protein Autoregressive Modeling via Multiscale Structure Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04883v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present protein autoregressive modeling (PAR), the first multi-scale autoregressive framework for protein backbone generation via coarse-to-fine next-scale prediction. Using the hierarchical nature of proteins, PAR generates structures that mimic sculpting a statue, forming a coarse topology and refining structural details over scales. To achieve this, PAR consists of three key components: (i) multi-scale downsampling operations that represent protein structures across multiple scales during training; (ii) an autoregressive transformer that encodes multi-scale information and produces conditional embeddings to guide structure generation; (iii) a flow-based backbone decoder that generates backbone atoms conditioned on these embeddings. Moreover, autoregressive models suffer from exposure bias, caused by the training and the generation procedure mismatch, and substantially degrades structure generation quality. We effectively alleviate this issue by adopting noisy context learning and scheduled sampling, enabling robust backbone generation. Notably, PAR exhibits strong zero-shot generalization, supporting flexible human-prompted conditional generation and motif scaffolding without requiring fine-tuning. On the unconditional generation benchmark, PAR effectively learns protein distributions and produces backbones of high design quality, and exhibits favorable scaling behavior. Together, these properties establish PAR as a promising framework for protein structure generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>ByteD...</summary><p>ByteDance Seed Tech Report; Page: https://par-protein.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[CoWTracker: Tracking by Warping instead of Correlation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04877v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dense point tracking is a fundamental problem in computer vision, with applications ranging from video analysis to robotic manipulation. State-of-the-art trackers typically rely on cost volumes to match features across frames, but this approach incurs quadratic complexity in spatial resolution, limiting scalability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose \method, a novel dense point tracker that eschews cost volumes in favor of warping. Inspired by recent advances in optical flow, our approach iteratively refines track estimates by warping features from the target frame to the query frame based on the current estimate. Combined with a transformer architecture that performs joint spatiotemporal reasoning across all tracks, our design establishes long-range correspondences without computing feature correlations. Our model is simple and achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard dense point tracking benchmarks, including TAP-Vid-DAVIS, TAP-Vid-Kinetics, and Robo-TAP. Remarkably, the model also excels at optical flow, sometimes outperforming specialized methods on the Sintel, KITTI, and Spring benchmarks. These results suggest that warping-based architectures can unify dense point tracking and optical flow estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project website: cowtracker.github.io</p></details> |

Existing evaluations, such as microcanonical molecular dynamics (MD), are computationally expensive and primarily probe near-equilibrium states. To improve evaluation metrics for MLIPs, we introduce the Bond Smoothness Characterization Test (BSCT). This efficient benchmark probes the PES via controlled bond deformations and detects non-smoothness, including discontinuities, artificial minima, and spurious forces, both near and far from equilibrium. We show that BSCT correlates strongly with MD stability while requiring a fraction of the cost of MD. To demonstrate how BSCT can guide iterative model design, we utilize an unconstrained Transformer backbone as a testbed, illustrating how refinements such as a new differentiable $k$-nearest neighbors algorithm and temperature-controlled attention reduce artifacts identified by our metric. By optimizing model design systematically based on BSCT, the resulting MLIP simultaneously achieves a low conventional E/F regression error, stable MD simulations, and robust atomistic property predictions. Our results establish BSCT as both a validation metric and as an "in-the-loop" model design proxy that alerts MLIP developers to physical challenges that cannot be efficiently evaluated by current MLIP benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages main text, 10 pages reference & appendix, 8 figures</p></details> |

However, assessment of low-grade dysplasia remains limited by subjective histopathologic interpretation. Advancements in digital pathology and deep learning provide new opportunities to identify subtle and fine morphologic patterns associated with malignant progression that may be imperceptible to the human eye. In this work, we propose XtraLight-MedMamba, an ultra-lightweight state-space-based deep learning framework for classifying neoplastic tubular adenomas from whole-slide images (WSIs). The architecture is a blend of ConvNext based shallow feature extractor with parallel vision mamba to efficiently model both long- and short-range dependencies and image generalization. An integration of Spatial and Channel Attention Bridge (SCAB) module enhances multiscale feature extraction, while Fixed Non-Negative Orthogonal Classifier (FNOClassifier) enables substantial parameter reduction and improved generalization. The model was evaluated on a curated dataset acquired from patients with low-grade tubular adenomas, stratified into case and control cohorts based on subsequent CRC development. XtraLight-MedMamba achieved an accuracy of 97.18% and an F1-score of 0.9767 using approximately 32,000 parameters, outperforming transformer-based and conventional Mamba architectures with significantly higher model complexity.</p></details> | 13 pages, 8 figures |

However, rigorously measuring this foundational capability is hindered by two obstacles: the entanglement of prior knowledge, where ``new'' knowledge may appear in pre-training data, and the entanglement of reasoning complexity, where failures may stem from problem difficulty rather than an inability to recall learned knowledge. We introduce SE-Bench, a diagnostic environment that obfuscates the NumPy library and its API doc into a pseudo-novel package with randomized identifiers. Agents are trained to internalize this package and evaluated on simple coding tasks without access to documentation, yielding a clean setting where tasks are trivial with the new API doc but impossible for base models without it. Our investigation reveals three insights: (1) the Open-Book Paradox, where training with reference documentation inhibits retention, requiring "Closed-Book Training" to force knowledge compression into weights; (2) the RL Gap, where standard RL fails to internalize new knowledge completely due to PPO clipping and negative gradients; and (3) the viability of Self-Play for internalization, proving models can learn from self-generated, noisy tasks when coupled with SFT, but not RL. Overall, SE-Bench establishes a rigorous diagnostic platform for self-evolution with knowledge internalization. Our code and dataset can be found at https://github.com/thunlp/SE-Bench.</p></details> | Under review |

However, their reliance on long multimodal token sequences leads to substantial computational overhead. Despite this challenge, token compression methods designed for Omni-LLMs remain limited. To bridge this gap, we propose OmniSIFT (Omni-modal Spatio-temporal Informed Fine-grained Token compression), a modality-asymmetric token compression framework tailored for Omni-LLMs. Specifically, OmniSIFT adopts a two-stage compression strategy: (i) a spatio-temporal video pruning module that removes video redundancy arising from both intra-frame structure and inter-frame overlap, and (ii) a vision-guided audio selection module that filters audio tokens. The entire framework is optimized end-to-end via a differentiable straight-through estimator. Extensive experiments on five representative benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of OmniSIFT. Notably, for Qwen2.5-Omni-7B, OmniSIFT introduces only 4.85M parameters while maintaining lower latency than training-free baselines such as OmniZip. With merely 25% of the original token context, OmniSIFT consistently outperforms all compression baselines and even surpasses the performance of the full-token model on several tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code will be released soon</p></details> |

A shared per-receiver encoder learns time-frequency structure within each received grid, and a token-wise cross-attention module fuses the receivers to produce soft log-likelihood ratios for a standard channel decoder, without requiring explicit per-receiver channel estimates. Trained with a bit-metric objective, the model adapts its fusion to per-receiver reliability, tolerates missing or degraded links, and remains robust when pilots are sparse. Across realistic Wi-Fi channels, it consistently outperforms classical pipelines and strong convolutional baselines, frequently matching (and in some cases surpassing) a powerful baseline that assumes perfect channel knowledge per access point. Despite its expressiveness, the architecture is compact, has low computational cost (low GFLOPs), and achieves low latency on GPUs, making it a practical building block for next-generation Wi-Fi receivers.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables, conference submission</p></details> |

SAR is a remote sensing method used in defense and security applications to detect and monitor the positions of military vehicles, which may appear indistinguishable in images. Researchers have extensively studied SAR ATR to improve the differentiation and identification of vehicle types, characteristics, and measurements. Test examples can be compared with known vehicle target types to improve recognition tasks. New methods enhance the capabilities of neural networks, transformer attention, and multimodal large language models. An agentic AI method may be developed to utilize a defined set of tools, such as searching through a library of similar examples. Our proposed method, SAR Retrieval-Augmented Generation (SAR-RAG), combines a multimodal large language model (MLLM) with a vector database of semantic embeddings to support contextual search for image exemplars with known qualities. By recovering past image examples with known true target types, our SAR-RAG system can compare similar vehicle categories, achieving improved ATR prediction accuracy. We evaluate this through search and retrieval metrics, categorical classification accuracy, and numeric regression of vehicle dimensions. These metrics all show improvements when SAR-RAG is added to an MLLM baseline method as an attached ATR memory bank.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to 2026 IEEE Radar Conference</p></details> |
| **[Towards Understanding and Avoiding Limitations of Convolutions on Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04709v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) have shown promising results, their real-world impact remains limited. Although various limitations have been identified, their theoretical foundations remain poorly understood, leading to fragmented research efforts. In this thesis, we provide an in-depth theoretical analysis and identify several key properties limiting the performance of MPNNs. Building on these findings, we propose several frameworks that address these shortcomings. We identify two properties exhibited by many MPNNs: shared component amplification (SCA), where each message-passing iteration amplifies the same components across all feature channels, and component dominance (CD), where a single component gets increasingly amplified as more message-passing steps are applied. These properties lead to the observable phenomenon of rank collapse of node representations, which generalizes the established over-smoothing phenomenon. By generalizing and decomposing over-smoothing, we enable a deeper understanding of MPNNs, more targeted solutions, and more precise communication within the field. To avoid SCA, we show that utilizing multiple computational graphs or edge relations is necessary. Our multi-relational split (MRS) framework transforms any existing MPNN into one that leverages multiple edge relations. Additionally, we introduce the spectral graph convolution for multiple feature channels (MIMO-GC), which naturally uses multiple computational graphs. A localized variant, LMGC, approximates the MIMO-GC while inheriting its beneficial properties. To address CD, we demonstrate a close connection between MPNNs and the PageRank algorithm. Based on personalized PageRank, we propose a variant of MPNNs that allows for infinitely many message-passing iterations, while preserving initial node features. Collectively, these results deepen the theoretical understanding of MPNNs.</p></details> | dissertation |

This holds promise for both gaining scientific insight and for producing inherently interpretable and generalizable models for tabular data. In this work we focus on the basics of SR. Deep learning-based SR has recently become competitive with genetic programming approaches, but the role of scale has remained largely unexplored. Inspired by scaling laws in language modeling, we present the first systematic investigation of scaling in SR, using a scalable end-to-end transformer pipeline and carefully generated training data. Across five different model sizes and spanning three orders of magnitude in compute, we find that both validation loss and solved rate follow clear power-law trends with compute. We further identify compute-optimal hyperparameter scaling: optimal batch size and learning rate grow with model size, and a token-to-parameter ratio of $\approx$15 is optimal in our regime, with a slight upward trend as compute increases. These results demonstrate that SR performance is largely predictable from compute and offer important insights for training the next generation of SR models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the NeurIPS 2025 Math-AI Workshop and the EurIPS 2025 AITD Workshop</p></details> |

MHSA provides frame-level attention scores, which are particularly valuable because deepfake artifacts often occur in small, localized regions along the temporal dimension of speech. This makes fine-grained frame modeling essential for accurately detecting subtle spoofing cues. In this work, we propose fine-grained frame modeling (FGFM) for MHSA-based speech deepfake detection, where the most informative frames are first selected through a multi-head voting (MHV) module. These selected frames are then refined via a cross-layer refinement (CLR) module to enhance the model's ability to learn subtle spoofing cues. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the baseline model and achieves Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.90%, 1.88%, and 6.64% on the LA21, DF21, and ITW datasets, respectively. These consistent improvements across multiple benchmarks highlight the effectiveness of our fine-grained modeling for robust speech deepfake detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP 2026</p></details> |

We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/szdtzpj/Breaking_the_moe_trilemma</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables.

We tested whether their concerns achieve proportional representation in public discourse shaping AI governance. Analyzing public AI-art discourse (news, podcasts, legal filings, research; 2013--2025) and projecting 1,259 survey-derived artist statements into this semantic space, we find stark compression: 95% of artist concerns cluster in 4 of 22 discourse topics, while 14 topics (62% of discourse) contain no artist perspective. This compression is selective - governance concerns (ownership, transparency) are 7x underrepresented; affective themes (threat, utility) show only 1.4x underrepresentation after style controls. The pattern indicates semantic, not stylistic, marginalization. These findings demonstrate a measurable representational gap: decision-makers relying on public discourse as a proxy for stakeholder priorities will systematically underweight those most affected. We introduce a consensus-based semantic projection methodology that is currently being validated across domains and generalizes to other stakeholder-technology contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

These transformations are applied to both first-moment updates, as in momentum SGD, and to root-mean-square (RMS) normalized gradient updates as in Adam. To enable efficient computation, we develop a coupled Newton iteration that avoids explicit singular value decomposition. Across controlled experiments, we find that RMS-normalized updates yield more stable optimization than first-moment updates. Moreover, while spectral compression provides strong stabilization benefits under first-moment updates, the Muon update (p = 0) does not consistently outperform Adam. These results suggest that Muon is best understood as an effective form of spectral normalization, but not a universally superior optimization method. Our source code will be released at https://github.com/Ocram7/BeyondMuon.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper studies matrix-based optimizers (e.g., Muon) from a spectral perspective and unifies a range of methods under a common spectral framework</p></details> |

While extensively studied in high-resource languages, STS remains challenging for under-resourced languages such as Slovak. This paper presents a comparative evaluation of sentence-level STS methods applied to Slovak, including traditional algorithms, supervised machine learning models, and third-party deep learning tools. We trained several machine learning models using outputs from traditional algorithms as features, with feature selection and hyperparameter tuning jointly guided by artificial bee colony optimization. Finally, we evaluated several third-party tools, including fine-tuned model by CloudNLP, OpenAI's embedding models, GPT-4 model, and pretrained SlovakBERT model.

Our approach addresses data imbalance by dynamically adjusting class weights, thereby enhancing performance on minority emotion classes without the computational burden of traditional resampling methods. We evaluate BERT, RoBERTa, and BART on the BRIGHTER dataset, using evaluation metrics such as Micro F1, Macro F1, ROC-AUC, Accuracy, and Jaccard similarity coefficients. The results demonstrate that the weighted loss function improves performance on high-frequency emotion classes but shows limited impact on minority classes. These findings underscore both the effectiveness and the challenges of applying this approach to imbalanced multi-label emotion detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, SemEval 2025</p></details> |

We design a canonical accumulation procedure that maps arbitrary configurations to configurations that occupy a fixed subset of vertices, enabling us to analyze configuration reachability in terms of equivalence classes. We prove that in instances that are not universally solvable, at least half of all configurations are unreachable from a given one, and leverage this to design an efficient randomized algorithm with one-sided error, which can be derandomized with a blow-up in the running time by a factor of p. Further, we optimize our deterministic algorithm by using the structure of the input graph G = (V, E), achieving a running time of O(p * (|V| + |E|)) in sparse graphs and O(|V| + |E|) in dense graphs. Finally, we consider the Graph Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (EAUS) problem, where given a connected graph G that is not universally solvable for p robots, the question is to check if for a given budget b, at most b edges can be added to G to make it universally solvable for p robots. We provide an upper bound of p - 2 on b for general graphs. On the other hand, we also provide examples of graphs that require Theta(p) edges to be added. We further study the Graph Vertex and Edge Augmentation for Universal Solvability (VEAUS) problem, where a vertices and b edges can be added, and we provide lower bounds on a and b.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to AAMAS 2026</p></details> |

Manual library migration is time consuming and error prone, as it requires developers to understand the Application Programming Interfaces (API) of both libraries, map equivalent APIs, and perform the necessary code transformations. Due to the difficulty of the library migration process, most of the existing automated techniques and tooling stop at the API mapping stage or support a limited set of libraries and code transformations. In this paper, we develop an end-to-end solution that can automatically migrate code between any arbitrary pair of Python libraries that provide similar functionality. Due to the promising capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation and transformation, we use LLMs as the primary engine for migration. Before building the tool, we first study the capabilities of LLMs for library migration on a benchmark of 321 real-world library migrations. We find that LLMs can effectively perform library migration, but some post-processing steps can further improve the performance. Based on this, we develop MigrateLib, a command line application that combines the power of LLMs, static analysis, and dynamic analysis to provide accurate library migration. We evaluate MigrateLib on 717 real-world Python applications that are not from our benchmark. We find that MigrateLib can migrate 32% of the migrations with complete correctness. Of the remaining migrations, only 14% of the migration-related changes are left for developers to fix for more than half of the projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2504.13272</p></details> |

However, the slow processing speeds and heavy resource consumption of diffusion models hinder their practical application and deployment. Quantization offers a potential solution for compressing the VSR model. Nevertheless, quantizing VSR models is challenging due to their temporal characteristics and high fidelity requirements. To address these issues, we propose QuantVSR, a low-bit quantization model for real-world VSR. We propose a spatio-temporal complexity aware (STCA) mechanism, where we first utilize the calibration dataset to measure both spatial and temporal complexities for each layer. Based on these statistics, we allocate layer-specific ranks to the low-rank full-precision (FP) auxiliary branch. Subsequently, we jointly refine the FP and low-bit branches to achieve simultaneous optimization. In addition, we propose a learnable bias alignment (LBA) module to reduce the biased quantization errors. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method obtains comparable performance with the FP model and significantly outperforms recent leading low-bit quantization methods.

Most general purpose encoders, however, are trained on generic corpora with limited coverage of specialized domains. We introduce RexBERT, a family of BERT-style encoders designed specifically for e-commerce semantics. We make three contributions. First, we release Ecom-niverse, a 350 billion token corpus curated from diverse retail and shopping sources. We describe a modular pipeline that isolates and extracts e-commerce content from FineFineWeb and other open web resources, and characterize the resulting domain distribution. Second, we present a reproducible pretraining recipe building on ModernBERT's architectural advances. The recipe consists of three phases: general pre-training, context extension, and annealed domain specialization. Third, we train RexBERT models ranging from 17M to 400M parameters and evaluate them on token classification, semantic similarity, and general natural language understanding tasks using e-commerce datasets. Despite having 2-3x fewer parameters, RexBERT outperforms larger general-purpose encoders and matches or surpasses modern long-context models on domain-specific benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that high quality in-domain data combined with a principled training approach provides a stronger foundation for e-commerce applications than indiscriminate scaling alone.</p></details> | <details><summary>Blog:...</summary><p>Blog: https://huggingface.co/blog/thebajajra/rexbert-encoders Models: https://huggingface.co/collections/thebajajra/rexbert Ecom-niverse Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/thebajajra/Ecom-niverse</p></details> |
| **[Toward Substantive Intersectional Algorithmic Fairness: Desiderata for a Feminist Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17944v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>People's experiences of discrimination are often shaped by multiple intersecting factors, yet algorithmic fairness research rarely reflects this complexity. While intersectionality offers tools for understanding how forms of oppression interact, current approaches to intersectional algorithmic fairness tend to focus on narrowly defined demographic subgroups. These methods contribute important insights but risk oversimplifying social reality and neglecting structural inequalities. In this paper, we outline how a substantive approach to intersectional algorithmic fairness can reorient this research and practice. In particular, we propose Substantive Intersectional Algorithmic Fairness, extending Green's (2022) notion of substantive algorithmic fairness with insights from intersectional feminist theory. Aiming to provide as actionable guidance as possible, our approach is articulated as ten desiderata to guide the design, assessment, and deployment of algorithmic systems that address systemic inequities while mitigating harms to intersectionally marginalized communities. Rather than prescribing fixed operationalizations, these desiderata invite AI practitioners and experts to reflect on assumptions of neutrality, the use of protected attributes, the inclusion of multiply marginalized groups, and the transformative potential of algorithmic systems. By bridging computational and social science perspectives, the approach emphasizes that fairness cannot be separated from social context, and that in some cases, principled non-deployment may be necessary.</p></details> | 28 pages |

However, there is currently no method for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN. Because it behaves, in an idealised limit, as a Bayesian in-context learner, we cast the decomposition challenge as a Bayesian predictive inference (BPI) problem. The main computational tool in BPI, predictive Monte Carlo, is challenging to apply here as it requires simulating unmodeled covariates. We therefore pursue the asymptotic alternative, filling a gap in the theory for supervised settings by proving a predictive CLT under quasi-martingale conditions. We derive variance estimators determined by the volatility of predictive updates along the context. The resulting credible bands are fast to compute, target epistemic uncertainty, and achieve near-nominal frequentist coverage. For classification, we further obtain an entropy-based uncertainty decomposition.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (+2 reference, +34 appendix).

Exact numerical calculation has either computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(M\times{}N)$ in the number of sources $M$ and evaluation points $N$, or requires a fixed evaluation grid to exploit fast Fourier transforms. Using an architecture where a hypernetwork produces an implicit representation of the field or potential around a source collection, our model instead performs as $\mathcal{O}(M + N)$, achieves relative error of $\sim\!4\%-6\%$, and allows evaluation at arbitrary locations for arbitrary numbers of sources, greatly increasing the speed of e.g.~physics simulations.

Unlike natural images, multiplex imaging lacks a fixed channel space, as real-world marker sets vary across studies, violating a core assumption of standard vision backbones. To address this, ImmuVis introduces marker-adaptive hyperconvolutions that generate convolutional kernels from learned marker embeddings, enabling a single model to operate on arbitrary measured marker subsets without retraining. We pretrain ImmuVis on the largest to-date dataset, IMC17M (28 cohorts, 24,405 images, 265 markers, over 17M patches), using self-supervised masked reconstruction. ImmuVis outperforms SOTA baselines and ablations in virtual staining and downstream classification tasks at substantially lower compute cost than transformer-based alternatives, and is the sole model that provides calibrated uncertainty via a heteroscedastic likelihood objective. These results position ImmuVis as a practical, efficient foundation model for real-world IMC modeling.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

Here, we offer an alternative approach: direct analog signal injection eliminates superfluous and power-intensive analog-to-digital and digital-to-analog conversions, making it particularly suitable for efficient near-sensor processing. We demonstrate this by using the accelerated BrainScaleS-2 mixed-signal neuromorphic research platform and interfacing it directly to microphones and a servo-motor-driven actuator. Utilizing BrainScaleS-2's 1000-fold acceleration factor, we employ a spiking neural network to transform interaural time differences into a spatial code and thereby predict the location of sound sources. Our primary contributions are the first demonstrations of direct, continuous-valued sensor data injection into the analog compute units of the BrainScaleS-2 ASIC, and actuator control using its embedded microprocessors. This enables a fully on-chip processing pipeline$\unicode{x2014}$from sensory input handling, via spiking neural network processing to physical action. We showcase this by programming the system to localize and align a servo motor with the spatial direction of transient noise peaks in real-time.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |

In this paper, we examine the problem of learning a dictionary that is invariant under a pre-specified group of transformations. Natural settings include Cryo-EM, multi-object tracking, synchronization, pose estimation, etc. We specifically study this problem under the lens of mathematical representation theory. Leveraging the power of non-abelian Fourier analysis for functions over compact groups, we prescribe an algorithmic recipe for learning dictionaries that obey such invariances. We relate the dictionary learning problem in the physical domain, which is naturally modelled as being infinite dimensional, with the associated computational problem, which is necessarily finite dimensional. We establish that the dictionary learning problem can be effectively understood as an optimization instance over certain matrix orbitopes having a particular block-diagonal structure governed by the irreducible representations of the group of symmetries. This perspective enables us to introduce a band-limiting procedure which obtains dimensionality reduction in applications. We provide guarantees for our computational ansatz to provide a desirable dictionary learning outcome. We apply our paradigm to investigate the dictionary learning problem for the groups SO(2) and SO(3). While the SO(2)-orbitope admits an exact spectrahedral description, substantially less is understood about the SO(3)-orbitope. We describe a tractable spectrahedral outer approximation of the SO(3)-orbitope, and contribute an alternating minimization paradigm to perform optimization in this setting. We provide numerical experiments to highlight the efficacy of our approach in learning SO(3)-invariant dictionaries, both on synthetic and on real world data.</p></details> | 33 pages, 3 figures |

However, weight sharing does not guarantee a stable token interface: during training, the correspondence between encoding tokens into hidden states and decoding hidden states into logits can drift, worsening optimization sensitivity and making post-training interventions such as editing, patching, and lightweight adaptation less predictable. We propose Pseudo-Inverse Tying (PIT), which synchronizes embedding and unembedding as coupled projections of a shared latent token memory, guaranteeing a pseudo-inverse-consistent interface throughout training. PIT maintains an orthonormal shared memory, obtained by thin polar decomposition for teacher initialization or random orthonormal initialization from scratch, and introduces a fully learned symmetric positive definite hidden-space transform parameterized via a Cholesky factor. The output head applies this transform to hidden states before the vocabulary projection, while the embedding applies the inverse transform to token vectors using stable triangular solves, avoiding explicit pseudo-inverse recomputation and any vocabulary-sized auxiliary parameters. We evaluate PIT on on-device models spanning 256M-1.3B parameters across pretraining and adaptation, and consistently observe improved training stability, stronger layerwise semantic consistency, and substantially reduced side effects.</p></details> | <details><summary>an ea...</summary><p>an early-stage version</p></details> |

However, existing pruning methods often rely on static importance scores, which fail to capture the evolving role of attention heads during iterative removal. We propose Greedy-Gradient norm (Greedy-Gnorm), a novel head pruning algorithm that dynamically recalculates head importance after each pruning step. Specifically, each head is scored by the elementwise product of the l2-norms of its Q/K/V gradient blocks, as estimated from a hold-out validation set and updated at every greedy iteration. This dynamic approach to scoring mitigates against stale rankings and better reflects gradient-informed importance as pruning progresses. Extensive experiments on BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, and XLM-RoBERTa demonstrate that Greedy-Gnorm consistently preserves accuracy under substantial head removal, outperforming attention entropy. By effectively reducing model size while maintaining task performance, Greedy-Gnorm offers a promising step toward more energy-efficient transformer model deployment.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Sparse Attention as Compact Kernel Regression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22766v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent work has revealed a link between self-attention mechanisms in transformers and test-time kernel regression via the Nadaraya-Watson estimator, with standard softmax attention corresponding to a Gaussian kernel. However, a kernel-theoretic understanding of sparse attention mechanisms is currently missing. In this paper, we establish a formal correspondence between sparse attention and compact (bounded support) kernels. We show that normalized ReLU and sparsemax attention arise from Epanechnikov kernel regression under fixed and adaptive normalizations, respectively. More generally, we demonstrate that widely used kernels in nonparametric density estimation -- including Epanechnikov, biweight, and triweight -- correspond to $α$-entmax attention with $α= 1 + \frac{1}{n}$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$, while the softmax/Gaussian relationship emerges in the limit $n \to \infty$. This unified perspective explains how sparsity naturally emerges from kernel design and provides principled alternatives to heuristic top-$k$ attention and other associative memory mechanisms. Experiments with a kernel-regression-based variant of transformers -- Memory Mosaics -- show that kernel-based sparse attention achieves competitive performance on language modeling, in-context learning, and length generalization tasks, offering a principled framework for designing attention mechanisms.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

Traditional speech enhancement methods typically rely on either masking, which focuses on suppressing non-speech components while preserving observable structure, or mapping, which seeks to recover clean speech through direct transformation of the input. Each approach offers strengths in specific scenarios but may be less effective outside its target conditions. We propose the Erase and Draw Network (EDNet), a versatile speech enhancement framework designed to handle a broad range of distortion types without prior assumptions about task or input characteristics. EDNet consists of two main components: (1) the Gating Mamba (GM) module, which adaptively combines masking and mapping through a learnable gating mechanism that selects between suppression (Erase) and reconstruction (Draw) based on local signal features, and (2) Phase Shift-Invariant Training (PSIT), a shift tolerant supervision strategy that improves phase estimation by enabling dynamic alignment during training while remaining compatible with standard loss functions. Experimental results on denoising, dereverberation, bandwidth extension, and multi distortion enhancement tasks show that EDNet consistently achieves strong performance across conditions, demonstrating its architectural flexibility and adaptability to diverse task settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech and Language Processing.

In this work, we explore the potential of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to perform GMNER in an end-to-end manner, moving beyond their typical role as auxiliary tools within cascaded pipelines. Crucially, our investigation reveals a fundamental challenge: MLLMs exhibit $\textbf{modality bias}$, including visual bias and textual bias, which stems from their tendency to take unimodal shortcuts rather than rigorous cross-modal verification. To address this, we propose Modality-aware Consistency Reasoning ($\textbf{MCR}$), which enforces structured cross-modal reasoning through Multi-style Reasoning Schema Injection (MRSI) and Constraint-guided Verifiable Optimization (CVO). MRSI transforms abstract constraints into executable reasoning chains, while CVO empowers the model to dynamically align its reasoning trajectories with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on GMNER and visual grounding tasks demonstrate that MCR effectively mitigates modality bias and achieves superior performance compared to existing baselines.</p></details> | GMNER |

To address this, we propose a unified framework that fuses LiDAR, GNSS, and IMU data for high-resolution city-scale mapping. The method performs velocity-based temporal alignment using Dynamic Time Warping and refines GNSS and IMU signals via extended Kalman filtering. Local maps are built using Normal Distributions Transform-based registration and pose graph optimization with loop closure detection, while global consistency is enforced using GNSS-constrained anchors followed by fine registration of overlapping segments. We also introduce a large-scale multimodal dataset captured in Perth, Western Australia to facilitate future research in this direction. Our dataset comprises 144,000 frames acquired with a 128-channel Ouster LiDAR, synchronized RTK-GNSS trajectories, and MEMS-IMU measurements across 21 urban loops. To assess geometric consistency, we evaluated our method using alignment metrics based on road centerlines and intersections to capture both global and local accuracy. The proposed framework reduces the average global alignment error from 3.32m to 1.24m, achieving a 61.4% improvement, and significantly decreases the intersection centroid offset from 13.22m to 2.01m, corresponding to an 84.8% enhancement.

Vision Language Models (VLMs) are essential to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems, but the reliance on third-person training data creates a viewpoint gap for humanoid robots. Collecting massive robot-centric data is an ideal but impractical solution due to cost and diversity constraints. Conversely, human egocentric videos offer a highly scalable data source with rich interaction context, yet the embodiment mismatch prevents the direct application. To bridge this gap, we propose an Egocentric2Embodiment Translation Pipeline that transforms raw human egocentric videos into multi-level, schema-driven embodiment supervision with enforced evidence grounding and temporal consistency, enabling the construction of the Egocentric2Embodiment dataset (E2E-3M) at scale. An egocentric-aware embodied brain, termed PhysBrain, is obtained by training on the E2E-3M dataset. PhysBrain exhibits substantially improved egocentric understanding, particularly for planning. It provides an egocentric-aware initialization that enables more sample-efficient VLA fine-tuning and higher success rates, demonstrating effective transfer from human egocentric supervision to downstream robot control.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

They not only incorporate open-world knowledge from large language models (LLMs) but also compress the semantic space to reduce generation difficulty. However, existing methods suffer from two major limitations: (1) the lack of contextual awareness in generation tasks leads to a gap between the Semantic ID codebook space and the generation space, resulting in suboptimal recommendations; and (2) suboptimal quantization methods exacerbate semantic loss in LLMs. To address these issues, we propose Dual-Flow Orthogonal Semantic IDs (DOS) method. Specifically, DOS employs a user-item dual flow-framework that leverages collaborative signals to align the Semantic ID codebook space with the generation space. Furthermore, we introduce an orthogonal residual quantization scheme that rotates the semantic space to an appropriate orientation, thereby maximizing semantic preservation. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B testing demonstrate the effectiveness of DOS. The proposed method has been successfully deployed in Meituan's mobile application, serving hundreds of millions of users.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by WWW2026 (short paper)</p></details> |

We analyze this limitation through circuit complexity: standard transformers are $\mathsf{TC}^0$-complete and cannot solve graph connectivity in constant depth, implying $Ω(k)$ layers are necessary for $k$-hop reasoning regardless of model size or training data. We introduce RASA (Relation-Aware Sparse Attention), a minimal architectural modification that provides structural inductive bias for relational reasoning. RASA adds: (1) sparse adjacency masking that restricts attention to graph-connected positions, reducing the attention pattern search space from $O(2^{n^2})$ to $O(2^m)$ for graphs with $m$ edges; and (2) learnable edge-type biases that encode relation-specific attention preferences. While RASA does not circumvent asymptotic depth requirements, the exponential reduction in attention pattern space provides stronger inductive bias for learning graph-structured functions. Empirically, on the MetaQA knowledge graph QA benchmark, RASA achieves 97.7% accuracy on 3-hop questions, outperforming EmbedKGQA (94.8%) by 2.9 percentage points. Notably, RASA's advantage grows with reasoning depth, validating that structural inductive bias is most beneficial for complex multi-hop queries. Our results demonstrate that minimal architectural modifications, grounded in complexity-theoretic analysis, can substantially improve multi-hop reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

| **[Theory of Speciation Transitions in Diffusion Models with General Class Structure](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04404v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion Models generate data by reversing a stochastic diffusion process, progressively transforming noise into structured samples drawn from a target distribution. Recent theoretical work has shown that this backward dynamics can undergo sharp qualitative transitions, known as speciation transitions, during which trajectories become dynamically committed to data classes. Existing theoretical analyses, however, are limited to settings where classes are identifiable through first moments, such as mixtures of Gaussians with well-separated means. In this work, we develop a general theory of speciation in diffusion models that applies to arbitrary target distributions admitting well-defined classes. We formalize the notion of class structure through Bayes classification and characterize speciation times in terms of free-entropy difference between classes. This criterion recovers known results in previously studied Gaussian-mixture models, while extending to situations in which classes are not distinguishable by first moments and may instead differ through higher-order or collective features. Our framework also accommodates multiple classes and predicts the existence of successive speciation times associated with increasingly fine-grained class commitment. We illustrate the theory on two analytically tractable examples: mixtures of one-dimensional Ising models at different temperatures and mixtures of zero-mean Gaussians with distinct covariance structures. In the Ising case, we obtain explicit expressions for speciation times by mapping the problem onto a random-field Ising model and solving it via the replica method. Our results provide a unified and broadly applicable description of speciation transitions in diffusion-based generative models.</p></details> | 17 pages, 6 figures |

To address this, we develop a closed-form likelihood for discretely observed incidence count data under the dynamical survival analysis (DSA) paradigm. The method approximates the stochastic population-level hazard by a large population limit while retaining a count-valued stochastic model, and leads to survival analytic inferential strategies that are both computationally efficient and flexible to model generalizations. Through simulation, we show that parameter estimation is competitive with recent exact but computationally expensive likelihood-based methods in partially observed settings. Previous work has shown that the DSA approximation is generalizable, and we show that the inferential developments here also carry over to models featuring individual heterogeneity, such as frailty models. We consider case studies of both Ebola and COVID-19 data on variants of the model, including a network-based epidemic model and a model with distributions over susceptibility, demonstrating its flexibility and practical utility on real, partially observed datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 figures and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Fixed Frames: Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23174v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural audio codecs are at the core of modern conversational speech technologies, converting continuous speech into sequences of discrete tokens that can be processed by LLMs. However, existing codecs typically operate at fixed frame rates, allocating tokens uniformly in time and producing unnecessarily long sequences. In this work, we introduce DyCAST, a Dynamic Character-Aligned Speech Tokenizer that enables variable-frame-rate tokenization through soft character-level alignment and explicit duration modeling. DyCAST learns to associate tokens with character-level linguistic units during training and supports alignment-free inference with direct control over token durations at decoding time. To improve speech resynthesis quality at low frame rates, we further introduce a retrieval-augmented decoding mechanism that enhances reconstruction fidelity without increasing bitrate. Experiments show that DyCAST achieves competitive speech resynthesis quality and downstream performance while using significantly fewer tokens than fixed-frame-rate codecs. Code and checkpoints will be released publicly at https://github.com/lucadellalib/dycast.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Attention Consistency Regularization for Interpretable Early-Exit Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08891v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Early-exit neural networks enable adaptive inference by allowing predictions at intermediate layers, reducing computational cost. However, early exits often lack interpretability and may focus on different features than deeper layers, limiting trust and explainability. This paper presents Explanation-Guided Training (EGT), a multi-objective framework that improves interpretability and consistency in early-exit networks through attention-based regularization. EGT introduces an attention consistency loss that aligns early-exit attention maps with the final exit. The framework jointly optimizes classification accuracy and attention consistency through a weighted combination of losses. Experiments on a real-world image classification dataset demonstrate that EGT achieves up to 98.97% overall accuracy (matching baseline performance) with a 1.97x inference speedup through early exits, while improving attention consistency by up to 18.5% compared to baseline models. The proposed method provides more interpretable and consistent explanations across all exit points, making early-exit networks more suitable for explainable AI applications in resource-constrained environments.</p></details> | 2 pages, 1 figure |

Early detection and accurate diagnosis of such conditions are important because they sometimes reveal our body's health problems. But it is challenging due to the inferred visual differences between disease types. This paper presents a machine learning-based model for automated classification of nail diseases based on a publicly available dataset, which contains 3,835 images scaling six categories. In 224x224 pixels, all images were resized to ensure consistency. To evaluate performance, four well-known CNN models-InceptionV3, DenseNet201, EfficientNetV2, and ResNet50 were trained and analyzed. Among these, InceptionV3 outperformed the others with an accuracy of 95.57%, while DenseNet201 came next with 94.79%. To make the model stronger and less likely to make mistakes on tricky or noisy images, we used adversarial training. To help understand how the model makes decisions, we used SHAP to highlight important features in the predictions. This system could be a helpful support for doctors, making nail disease diagnosis more accurate and faster.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 12 figures.

In this paper, we show that contemporary Large Language Model (LLM)-based systems can also read, generate, and reason with design patterns written in a structured template. We describe an experimental workflow in which patterns function as shared priors for action selection, reflection, and revision in hybrid human/agent settings. Drawing on the Active Inference Framework, we illustrate how patterns can guide agent behavior without fully prescribing it. This provides a proof of concept that pattern-capable agents can be created using now-standard software tools. We discuss implications for software development, education, business, and AI governance.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages with 4 page appendix; to appear in Proceedings of Pattern Languages of Programs 2025</p></details> |
| **[Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14665v4)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schrödinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Main:...</summary><p>Main: 13 pages plus references, 11 figures and tables.

This paper focuses on achieving accurate, fast, and robust wind speed prediction by full use of cluster data with spatial-temporal correlation. First, weighted mean filtering (WMF) is applied to denoise wind speed data at the single-farm level. The Legendre memory unit (LMU) is then innovatively applied for the wind speed prediction, in combination with the Compensating Parameter based on Kendall rank correlation coefficient (CPK) of wind farm cluster data, to construct the multi-slice LMU (MSLMU). Finally, an innovative ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU is proposed herein, with three key blocks: data pre-processing, forecasting, and multi-slice compensation. Advantages include: 1) LMU jointly models linear and nonlinear dependencies among farms to capture spatial-temporal correlations through backpropagation; 2) MSLMU enhances forecasting by using CPK-derived weights instead of random initialization, allowing spatial correlations to fully activate hidden nodes across clustered wind farms.; 3) CPK adaptively weights the compensation model in MSLMU and complements missing data spatially, to facilitate the whole model highly accurate and robust. Test results on different wind farm clusters indicate the effectiveness and superiority of proposed ensemble model WMF-CPK-MSLMU in the short-term prediction of wind farm clusters compared to the existing models.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 11 figures,</p></details> |

In this work, we use the hypothesis-testing interpretation of DP ($f$-DP), and determine that bounds on attack success can take the same unified form across re-identification, attribute inference, and data reconstruction risks. Our unified bounds are (1) consistent across a multitude of attack settings, and (2) tunable, enabling practitioners to evaluate risk with respect to arbitrary, including worst-case, levels of baseline risk. Empirically, our results are tighter than prior methods using $\varepsilon$-DP, Rényi DP, and concentrated DP. As a result, calibrating noise using our bounds can reduce the required noise by 20% at the same risk level, which yields, e.g., an accuracy increase from 52% to 70% in a text classification task. Overall, this unifying perspective provides a principled framework for interpreting and calibrating the degree of protection in DP against specific levels of re-identification, attribute inference, or data reconstruction risk.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Generative Modeling via Drifting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04770v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative modeling can be formulated as learning a mapping f such that its pushforward distribution matches the data distribution. The pushforward behavior can be carried out iteratively at inference time, for example in diffusion and flow-based models. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm called Drifting Models, which evolve the pushforward distribution during training and naturally admit one-step inference. We introduce a drifting field that governs the sample movement and achieves equilibrium when the distributions match. This leads to a training objective that allows the neural network optimizer to evolve the distribution. In experiments, our one-step generator achieves state-of-the-art results on ImageNet at 256 x 256 resolution, with an FID of 1.54 in latent space and 1.61 in pixel space. We hope that our work opens up new opportunities for high-quality one-step generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://lambertae.github.io/projects/drifting/</p></details> |

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved MT system performance, adapting them to lesser-represented languages remains challenging. In-context learning (ICL) may offer novel ways to adapt LLMs for low-resource MT by conditioning models on demonstration at inference time. In this study, we explore scaling low-resource machine translation ICL beyond the few-shot setting to thousands of examples with long-context models. We scale in-context token budget to 1M tokens and compare three types of training corpora used as in-context supervision: monolingual unsupervised data, instruction-style data, and parallel data (English--target and Indonesian--target). Our experiments on Javanese and Sundanese show that gains from additional context saturate quickly and can degrade near the maximum context window, with scaling behavior strongly dependent on corpus type. Notably, some forms of monolingual supervision can be competitive with parallel data, despite the latter offering additional supervision. Overall, our results characterize the effective limits and corpus-type sensitivity of long-context ICL for low-resource MT, highlighting that larger context windows do not necessarily yield proportional quality gains.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 18 figures, EACL 2026 Conference - LoResMT workshop</p></details> |

Researchers have endeavored for decades to develop computational methods to predict the distribution of conformations, which is far harder to determine experimentally than a static folded structure. We present ConforMix, an inference-time algorithm that enhances sampling of conformational distributions using a combination of classifier guidance, filtering, and free energy estimation. Our approach upgrades diffusion models -- whether trained for static structure prediction or conformational generation -- to enable more efficient discovery of conformational variability without requiring prior knowledge of major degrees of freedom. ConforMix is orthogonal to improvements in model pretraining and would benefit even a hypothetical model that perfectly reproduced the Boltzmann distribution. Remarkably, when applied to a diffusion model trained for static structure prediction, ConforMix captures structural changes including domain motion, cryptic pocket flexibility, and transporter cycling, while avoiding unphysical states. Case studies of biologically critical proteins demonstrate the scalability, accuracy, and utility of this method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/drorlab/conformix</p></details> |

We propose Adaptive Prompt Elicitation (APE), a technique that adaptively asks visual queries to help users refine prompts without extensive writing. Our technical contribution is a formulation of interactive intent inference under an information-theoretic framework. APE represents latent intent as interpretable feature requirements using language model priors, adaptively generates visual queries, and compiles elicited requirements into effective prompts. Evaluation on IDEA-Bench and DesignBench shows that APE achieves stronger alignment with improved efficiency. A user study with challenging user-defined tasks demonstrates 19.8% higher alignment without workload overhead. Our work contributes a principled approach to prompting that, for general users, offers an effective and efficient complement to the prevailing prompt-based interaction paradigm with text-to-image models.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACM I...</summary><p>ACM International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI) 2026, March 23-26, Paphos, Cyprus</p></details> |

Motivated by this, we revisit the geometry of the Cholesky factors and uncover a simple product structure that enables convenient metric design. Building on this insight, we propose two fast and stable SPD metrics, Power--Cholesky Metric (PCM) and Bures--Wasserstein--Cholesky Metric (BWCM), derived via Cholesky decomposition. Compared with existing SPD metrics, the proposed metrics provide closed-form operators, computational efficiency, and improved numerical stability. We further apply our metrics to construct Riemannian Multinomial Logistic Regression (MLR) classifiers and residual blocks for SPD neural networks. Experiments on SPD deep learning, numerical stability analyses, and tensor interpolation demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness of our metrics.

However, their potential in space-related applications remains largely unexplored. In the space domain, accurate manual annotation is particularly challenging due to factors such as low visibility, illumination variations, and object blending with planetary backgrounds. Developing methods that can detect and segment spacecraft and orbital targets without requiring extensive manual labeling is therefore of critical importance. In this work, we propose an annotation-free detection and segmentation pipeline for space targets using VLMs. Our approach begins by automatically generating pseudo-labels for a small subset of unlabeled real data with a pre-trained VLM. These pseudo-labels are then leveraged in a teacher-student label distillation framework to train lightweight models. Despite the inherent noise in the pseudo-labels, the distillation process leads to substantial performance gains over direct zero-shot VLM inference. Experimental evaluations on the SPARK-2024, SPEED+, and TANGO datasets on segmentation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements in average precision (AP) by up to 10 points.

| **[Generative Modeling of Neural Dynamics via Latent Stochastic Differential Equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12112v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a probabilistic framework for developing computational models of biological neural systems. In this framework, physiological recordings are viewed as discrete-time partial observations of an underlying continuous-time stochastic dynamical system which implements computations through its state evolution. To model this dynamical system, we employ a system of coupled stochastic differential equations with differentiable drift and diffusion functions and use variational inference to infer its states and parameters. This formulation enables seamless integration of existing mathematical models in the literature, neural networks, or a hybrid of both to learn and compare different models. We demonstrate this in our framework by developing a generative model that combines coupled oscillators with neural networks to capture latent population dynamics from single-cell recordings. Evaluation across three neuroscience datasets spanning different species, brain regions, and behavioral tasks show that these hybrid models achieve competitive performance in predicting stimulus-evoked neural and behavioral responses compared to sophisticated black-box approaches while requiring an order of magnitude fewer parameters, providing uncertainty estimates, and offering a natural language for interpretation.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[Abstract Framework for All-Path Reachability Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04641v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An all-path reachability (APR, for short) predicate is a pair of a source set and a target set, which are subsets of an object set. APR predicates have been defined for abstract reduction systems (ARSs, for short) and then extended to logically constrained term rewrite systems (LCTRSs, for short) as pairs of constrained terms that represent sets of terms modeling configurations, states, etc. An APR predicate is said to be partially (or demonically) valid w.r.t. a rewrite system if every finite maximal reduction sequence of the system starting from any element in the source set includes an element in the target set. Partial validity of APR predicates w.r.t. ARSs is defined by means of two inference rules, which can be considered a proof system to construct (possibly infinite) derivation trees for partial validity. On the other hand, a proof system for LCTRSs consists of four inference rules, and thus there is a gap between the inference rules for partial validity w.r.t. ARSs and LCTRSs. In this paper, we revisit the framework for APR analysis and adapt it to verification of not only safety but also liveness properties. To this end, we first reformulate an abstract framework for partial validity w.r.t. ARSs so that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the inference rules for ARSs and LCTRSs. Secondly, we show how to apply APR analysis to safety verification. Thirdly, to apply APR analysis to liveness verification, we introduce a novel stronger validity of APR predicates, called total validity, which requires not only finite but also infinite execution paths to reach target sets. Finally, for a partially valid APR predicate with a cyclic-proof tree, we show a necessary and sufficient condition for the tree to ensure total validity, showing how to apply APR analysis to liveness verification.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Estimating the rate of such infection, alongside the rates of introduction of infection from outside the partnership, is a special case of the more general epidemiological challenge of inferring intensities of within- and between-group intensities of transmission. This study presents a stochastic susceptible-infected (SI) pair model for estimating key epidemiological parameters governing HIV transmission within and between couples, which we further extend to account for gender-specific differences in infection dynamics. Using a likelihood-based inference approach, we estimate transmission parameters and associated uncertainty from observed data. These values can be used to inform infection prevention strategies for HIV, and the methodology proposed can be generalised to other epidemiological settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 3 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, existing GNN-based methods typically suffer from restricted receptive fields that miss long-range dependencies and a "single-pass" inference paradigm that leads to error accumulation. To address these bottlenecks, we propose RIGA-Fold, a framework that synergizes Recurrent Interaction with Geometric Awareness. At the micro-level, we introduce a Geometric Attention Update (GAU) module where edge features explicitly serve as attention keys, ensuring strictly SE(3)-invariant local encoding. At the macro-level, we design an attention-based Global Context Bridge that acts as a soft gating mechanism to dynamically inject global topological information. Furthermore, to bridge the gap between structural and sequence modalities, we introduce an enhanced variant, RIGA-Fold*, which integrates trainable geometric features with frozen evolutionary priors from ESM-2 and ESM-IF via a dual-stream architecture. Finally, a biologically inspired ``predict-recycle-refine'' strategy is implemented to iteratively denoise sequence distributions. Extensive experiments on CATH 4.2, TS50, and TS500 benchmarks demonstrate that our geometric framework is highly competitive, while RIGA-Fold* significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both sequence recovery and structural consistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Relational Scene Graphs for Object Grounding of Natural Language Commands](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04635v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots are finding wider adoption in human environments, increasing the need for natural human-robot interaction. However, understanding a natural language command requires the robot to infer the intended task and how to decompose it into executable actions, and to ground those actions in the robot's knowledge of the environment, including relevant objects, agents, and locations. This challenge can be addressed by combining the capabilities of Large language models (LLMs) to understand natural language with 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) for grounding inferred actions in a semantic representation of the environment. However, many 3DSGs lack explicit spatial relations between objects, even though humans often rely on these relations to describe an environment. This paper investigates whether incorporating open- or closed-vocabulary spatial relations into 3DSGs can improve the ability of LLMs to interpret natural language commands. To address this, we propose an LLM-based pipeline for target object grounding from open-vocabulary language commands and a vision language model (VLM)-based pipeline to add open-vocabulary spatial edges to 3DSGs from images captured while mapping. Finally, two LLMs are evaluated in a study assessing their performance on the downstream task of target object grounding. Our study demonstrates that explicit spatial relations improve the ability of LLMs to ground objects. Moreover, open-vocabulary relation generation with VLMs proves feasible from robot-captured images, but their advantage over closed-vocabulary relations is found to be limited.</p></details> | In review for RA-L |

However, there is currently no method for uncertainty decomposition in TabPFN. Because it behaves, in an idealised limit, as a Bayesian in-context learner, we cast the decomposition challenge as a Bayesian predictive inference (BPI) problem. The main computational tool in BPI, predictive Monte Carlo, is challenging to apply here as it requires simulating unmodeled covariates. We therefore pursue the asymptotic alternative, filling a gap in the theory for supervised settings by proving a predictive CLT under quasi-martingale conditions. We derive variance estimators determined by the volatility of predictive updates along the context. The resulting credible bands are fast to compute, target epistemic uncertainty, and achieve near-nominal frequentist coverage. For classification, we further obtain an entropy-based uncertainty decomposition.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages (+2 reference, +34 appendix).

In such models, Bayesian inference gives an estimate of uncertainty but is analytically intractable and requires costly approximation using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. Neural posterior estimation shifts the bulk of computation from inference time to pre-training time, amortizing over simulated datasets with known ground truth targets. We propose metabeta, a neural network model for Bayesian mixed-effects regression. Using simulated and real data, we show that it reaches stable and comparable performance to MCMC-based parameter estimation at a fraction of the usually required time, enabling new use cases for Bayesian mixed-effects modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 9 main text, 8 figures</p></details> |

(2022)]: among all conversion rules that map a Rényi Differential Privacy (RDP) profile $τ\mapsto ρ(τ)$ to a valid hypothesis-testing trade-off $f$, the rule based on the intersection of single-order RDP privacy regions is optimal. This optimality holds simultaneously for all valid RDP profiles and for all Type I error levels $α$. Concretely, we show that in the space of trade-off functions, the tightest possible bound is $f_{ρ(\cdot)}(α) = \sup_{τ\geq 0.5} f_{τ,ρ(τ)}(α)$: the pointwise maximum of the single-order bounds for each RDP privacy region. Our proof unifies and sharpens the insights of [Balle et al. (2019)], [Asoodeh et al. (2021)], and [Zhu et al. (2022)]. Our analysis relies on a precise geometric characterization of the RDP privacy region, leveraging its convexity and the fact that its boundary is determined exclusively by Bernoulli mechanisms. Our results establish that the "intersection-of-RDP-privacy-regions" rule is not only valid, but optimal: no other black-box conversion can uniformly dominate it in the Blackwell sense, marking the fundamental limit of what can be inferred about a mechanism's privacy solely from its RDP guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

While recent approaches attempt to alleviate this by sharing a single set of crucial tokens across layers, such coarse-grained sharing undermines model performance by neglecting the functional diversity of attention heads. To address this, we propose LycheeDecode, an efficient decoding method centered on a fine-grained hybrid-head attention mechanism that employs a hardware-efficient top-k selection strategy. Specifically, the novel HardKuma-based mechanism partitions attention heads into a small subset of retrieval heads that dynamically identify crucial tokens and a majority of sparse heads that reuse them for efficient computation. Through extensive experiments on leading models like Llama3 and Qwen3 across diverse benchmarks for long-context understanding (e.g., LongBench, RULER) and complex reasoning (e.g., AIME24, OlympiadBench), we demonstrate that LycheeDecode achieves generative quality comparable to, and at times surpassing even the full-attention baseline. Crucially, this is accomplished with up to a 2.7x speedup at a 128K context length. By preserving the functional diversity of attention heads, our fine-grained strategy overcomes the performance bottlenecks of existing methods, providing a powerful and validated pathway to both efficient and high-quality long-context LLM inference.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[An Efficient Bayesian Framework for Inverse Problems via Optimization and Inversion: Surrogate Modeling, Parameter Inference, and Uncertainty Quantification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04537v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The present paper proposes a Bayesian framework for inverse problems that seamlessly integrates optimization and inversion to enable rapid surrogate modeling, accurate parameter inference, and rigorous uncertainty quantification. Bayesian optimization is employed to adaptively construct accurate Gaussian process surrogate models using a minimal number of high-fidelity model evaluations, strategically focusing sampling in regions of high predictive uncertainty. The trained surrogate model is then leveraged within a Bayesian inversion scheme to infer optimal parameter values by combining prior knowledge with observed quantities of interest, resulting in posterior distributions that rigorously characterize epistemic uncertainty. The framework is theoretically grounded, computationally efficient, and particularly suited for engineering applications in which high-fidelity models -- whether arising from numerical simulations or physical experiments -- are computationally expensive, analytically intractable, or difficult to replicate, and data availability is limited. Furthermore, the combined use of Bayesian optimization and inversion outperforms their separate application, highlighting the synergistic benefits of unifying the two approaches. The performance of the proposed Bayesian framework is demonstrated on a suite of one- and two-dimensional analytical benchmarks, including the Mixed Gaussian-Periodic, Lévy, Griewank, Forrester, and Rosenbrock functions, which provide a controlled setting to assess surrogate modeling accuracy, parameter inference robustness, and uncertainty quantification. The results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in efficiently solving inverse problems while providing informative uncertainty quantification and supporting reliable engineering decision-making at reduced computational cost.</p></details> | Under review |

These studies typically only identify correlations between their set of variables without accounting for interactions with external variables, such as confounding factors. Objective: Within this study, we provide a broad empirical view on practices of software development and their relation to bug-introducing changes \rev{to enable} future work on causal relations between those aspects. Method: We consider the bugs, the type of change that introduced the bug, aspects of the build process, code review, software tests, and any other discussion related to the bug that we can identify. We use a qualitative approach that first describes variables of the development process and then groups the variables based on their relations. From these groups, we deduce how their (pairwise) interactions affect bug-introducing changes. Results: We found multiple relevant relations within the development process of bug-introducing changes. Logical groups of variables and their relations provide a framework for discovering areas of interest regarding intermediate effects in the process and confounders towards bug-introduction. Conclusion: Software engineering practices applied during the development of bug-introducing changes are interdependent. This work lays the foundation to understand why bugs are introduced using causal modeling, discovery, and inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal</p></details> |
| **[DAISI: Data Assimilation with Inverse Sampling using Stochastic Interpolants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00252v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data assimilation (DA) is a cornerstone of scientific and engineering applications, combining model forecasts with sparse and noisy observations to estimate latent system states. Classical high-dimensional DA methods, such as the ensemble Kalman filter, rely on Gaussian approximations that are violated for complex dynamics or observation operators. To address this limitation, we introduce DAISI, a scalable filtering algorithm built on flow-based generative models that enables flexible probabilistic inference using data-driven priors. The core idea is to use a stationary, pre-trained generative prior that first incorporates forecast information through a novel inverse-sampling step, before assimilating observations via guidance-based conditional sampling. This allows us to leverage any forecasting model as part of the DA pipeline without having to retrain or fine-tune the generative prior at each assimilation step. Experiments on challenging nonlinear systems show that DAISI achieves accurate filtering results in regimes with sparse, noisy, and nonlinear observations where traditional methods struggle.</p></details> | 44 pages, 26 figures |
| **[Learning the Value Systems of Agents with Preference-based and Inverse Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04518v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agreement Technologies refer to open computer systems in which autonomous software agents interact with one another, typically on behalf of humans, in order to come to mutually acceptable agreements. With the advance of AI systems in recent years, it has become apparent that such agreements, in order to be acceptable to the involved parties, must remain aligned with ethical principles and moral values. However, this is notoriously difficult to ensure, especially as different human users (and their software agents) may hold different value systems, i.e. they may differently weigh the importance of individual moral values. Furthermore, it is often hard to specify the precise meaning of a value in a particular context in a computational manner. Methods to estimate value systems based on human-engineered specifications, e.g. based on value surveys, are limited in scale due to the need for intense human moderation. In this article, we propose a novel method to automatically \emph{learn} value systems from observations and human demonstrations. In particular, we propose a formal model of the \emph{value system learning} problem, its instantiation to sequential decision-making domains based on multi-objective Markov decision processes, as well as tailored preference-based and inverse reinforcement learning algorithms to infer value grounding functions and value systems. The approach is illustrated and evaluated by two simulated use cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 5 figures.

The proposed methodology extends PINN to account for prior knowledge on the nature of the expected NN output, as well as its weights. Also, as we can have access to the posterior probability distributions, naturally uncertainties can be quantified. Also, variational inference and Monte Carlo dropout are employed to provide predictive means and variances for reconstructed images. Un example of applications to deconvolution and super-resolution is considered, details of the different steps of implementations are given, and some preliminary results are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ICIP 2006 conference</p></details> |
| **[Journey to the Centre of Cluster: Harnessing Interior Nodes for A/B Testing under Network Interference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04457v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A/B testing on platforms often faces challenges from network interference, where a unit's outcome depends not only on its own treatment but also on the treatments of its network neighbors. To address this, cluster-level randomization has become standard, enabling the use of network-aware estimators. These estimators typically trim the data to retain only a subset of informative units, achieving low bias under suitable conditions but often suffering from high variance. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the interior nodes - units whose neighbors all lie within the same cluster - constitute the vast majority of the post-trimming subpopulation. In light of this, we propose directly averaging over the interior nodes to construct the mean-in-interior (MII) estimator, which circumvents the delicate reweighting required by existing network-aware estimators and substantially reduces variance in classical settings. However, we show that interior nodes are often not representative of the full population, particularly in terms of network-dependent covariates, leading to notable bias. We then augment the MII estimator with a counterfactual predictor trained on the entire network, allowing us to adjust for covariate distribution shifts between the interior nodes and full population. By rearranging the expression, we reveal that our augmented MII estimator embodies an analytical form of the point estimator within prediction-powered inference framework. This insight motivates a semi-supervised lens, wherein interior nodes are treated as labeled data subject to selection bias. Extensive and challenging simulation studies demonstrate the outstanding performance of our augmented MII estimator across various settings.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[RETENTION: Resource-Efficient Tree-Based Ensemble Model Acceleration with Content-Addressable Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05994v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although deep learning has demonstrated remarkable capability in learning from unstructured data, modern tree-based ensemble models remain superior in extracting relevant information and learning from structured datasets. While several efforts have been made to accelerate tree-based models, the inherent characteristics of the models pose significant challenges for conventional accelerators. Recent research leveraging content-addressable memory (CAM) offers a promising solution for accelerating tree-based models, yet existing designs suffer from excessive memory consumption and low utilization. This work addresses these challenges by introducing RETENTION, an end-to-end framework that significantly reduces CAM capacity requirement for tree-based model inference. We propose an iterative pruning algorithm with a novel pruning criterion tailored for bagging-based models (e.g., Random Forest), which minimizes model complexity while ensuring controlled accuracy degradation. Additionally, we present a tree mapping scheme that incorporates two innovative data placement strategies to alleviate the memory redundancy caused by the widespread use of don't care states in CAM. Experimental results show that implementing the tree mapping scheme alone reduces CAM capacity requirement by $1.46\times$ to $21.30 \times$, while the full RETENTION framework achieves $4.35\times$ to $207.12\times$ reduction with less than 3\% accuracy loss. These results demonstrate that RETENTION is highly effective in minimizing CAM resource demand, providing a resource-efficient direction for tree-based model acceleration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review by IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits & Systems</p></details> |
| **[Gust Estimation and Rejection with a Disturbance Observer for Proprioceptive Underwater Soft Morphing Wings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04438v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unmanned underwater vehicles are increasingly employed for maintenance and surveying tasks at sea, but their operation in shallow waters is often hindered by hydrodynamic disturbances such as waves, currents, and turbulence. These unsteady flows can induce rapid changes in direction and speed, compromising vehicle stability and manoeuvrability. Marine organisms contend with such conditions by combining proprioceptive feedback with flexible fins and tails to reject disturbances. Inspired by this strategy, we propose soft morphing wings endowed with proprioceptive sensing to mitigate environmental perturbations. The wing's continuous deformation provides a natural means to infer dynamic disturbances: sudden changes in camber directly reflect variations in the oncoming flow. By interpreting this proprioceptive signal, a disturbance observer can reconstruct flow parameters in real time. To enable this, we develop and experimentally validate a dynamic model of a hydraulically actuated soft wing with controllable camber. We then show that curvature-based sensing allows accurate estimation of disturbances in the angle of attack. Finally, we demonstrate that a controller leveraging these proprioceptive estimates can reject disturbances in the lift response of the soft wing. By combining proprioceptive sensing with a disturbance observer, this technique mirrors biological strategies and provides a pathway for soft underwater vehicles to maintain stability in hazardous environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>2026 ...</summary><p>2026 IEEE International Conference on Robotics & Automation (ICRA)</p></details> |
| **[Sparse-to-Sparse Training of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21380v2)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models (DMs) are a powerful type of generative models that have achieved state-of-the-art results in various image synthesis tasks and have shown potential in other domains, such as natural language processing and temporal data modeling. Despite their stable training dynamics and ability to produce diverse high-quality samples, DMs are notorious for requiring significant computational resources, both in the training and inference stages. Previous work has focused mostly on increasing the efficiency of model inference. This paper introduces, for the first time, the paradigm of sparse-to-sparse training to DMs, with the aim of improving both training and inference efficiency. We focus on unconditional generation and train sparse DMs from scratch (Latent Diffusion and ChiroDiff) on six datasets using three different methods (Static-DM, RigL-DM, and MagRan-DM) to study the effect of sparsity in model performance. Our experiments show that sparse DMs are able to match and often outperform their Dense counterparts, while substantially reducing the number of trainable parameters and FLOPs. We also identify safe and effective values to perform sparse-to-sparse training of DMs.</p></details> | Accepted to TMLR |
