| **[UniX: Unifying Autoregression and Diffusion for Chest X-Ray Understanding and Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11522v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress, medical foundation models still struggle to unify visual understanding and generation, as these tasks have inherently conflicting goals: semantic abstraction versus pixel-level reconstruction. Existing approaches, typically based on parameter-shared autoregressive architectures, frequently lead to compromised performance in one or both tasks. To address this, we present UniX, a next-generation unified medical foundation model for chest X-ray understanding and generation. UniX decouples the two tasks into an autoregressive branch for understanding and a diffusion branch for high-fidelity generation. Crucially, a cross-modal self-attention mechanism is introduced to dynamically guide the generation process with understanding features. Coupled with a rigorous data cleaning pipeline and a multi-stage training strategy, this architecture enables synergistic collaboration between tasks while leveraging the strengths of diffusion models for superior generation. On two representative benchmarks, UniX achieves a 46.1% improvement in understanding performance (Micro-F1) and a 24.2% gain in generation quality (FD-RadDino), using only a quarter of the parameters of LLM-CXR. By achieving performance on par with task-specific models, our work establishes a scalable paradigm for synergistic medical image understanding and generation.

| **[Predictive Modeling of Power Outages during Extreme Events: Integrating Weather and Socio-Economic Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22699v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel learning based framework for predicting power outages caused by extreme events. The proposed approach targets low probability high consequence outage scenarios and leverages a comprehensive set of features derived from publicly available data sources. We integrate EAGLE-I outage records from 2014 to 2024 with weather, socioeconomic, infrastructure, and seasonal event data. Incorporating social and demographic indicators reveals patterns of community vulnerability and improves understanding of outage risk during extreme conditions. Four machine learning models are evaluated including Random Forest (RF), Graph Neural Network (GNN), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). Experimental validation is performed on a large scale dataset covering counties in the lower peninsula of Michigan. Among all models tested, the LSTM network achieves higher accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint of a manuscript currently under review at Electric Power Systems Research.

| **[ShapeR: Robust Conditional 3D Shape Generation from Casual Captures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11514v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D shape generation have achieved impressive results, but most existing methods rely on clean, unoccluded, and well-segmented inputs. Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://facebookresearch.github.io/ShapeR Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbY30KAA55I</p></details> |
| **[Capacity Constraints Make Admissions Processes Less Predictable](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11513v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning models are often used to make predictions about admissions process outcomes, such as for colleges or jobs. However, such decision processes differ substantially from the conventional machine learning paradigm. Because admissions decisions are capacity-constrained, whether a student is admitted depends on the other applicants who apply. We show how this dependence affects predictive performance even in otherwise ideal settings. Theoretically, we introduce two concepts that characterize the relationship between admission function properties, machine learning representation, and generalization to applicant pool distribution shifts: instability, which measures how many existing decisions can change when a single new applicant is introduced; and variability, which measures the number of unique students whose decisions can change. Empirically, we illustrate our theory on individual-level admissions data from the New York City high school matching system, showing that machine learning performance degrades as the applicant pool increasingly differs from the training data. Furthermore, there are larger performance drops for schools using decision rules that are more unstable and variable. Our work raises questions about the reliability of predicting individual admissions probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted to the 2026 AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence AI for Social Impact Track</p></details> |
| **[From Aggregation to Selection: User-Validated Distributed Social Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21388v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Social recommender systems facilitate social connections by identifying potential friends for users. Each user maintains a local social network centered around themselves, resulting in a naturally distributed social structure. Recent research on distributed modeling for social recommender systems has gained increasing attention, as it naturally aligns with the user-centric structure of user interactions. Current distributed social recommender systems rely on automatically combining predictions from multiple models, often overlooking the user's active role in validating whether suggested connections are appropriate. Moreover, recommendation decisions are validated by individual users rather than derived from a single global ordering of candidates. As a result, standard ranking-based evaluation metrics make it difficult to evaluate whether a user-confirmed recommendation decision is actually correct. To address these limitations, we propose DeSocial, a distributed social recommendation framework with user-validation. DeSocial enables users to select recommendation algorithms to validate their potential connections, and the verification is processed through majority consensus among multiple independent user validators. To evaluate the distributed recommender system with user validator, we formulate this setting as a link prediction and verification task and introduce Acc@K, a consensus-based evaluation metric that measures whether user-approved recommendations are correct. Experiments on 4 real-world social networks shows that DeSocial improves decision correctness and robustness compared to single-point and distributed baselines. These findings highlight the potential of user-validated distributed recommender systems as a practical approach to social recommendation, with broader applicability to distributed and decentralized recommendations.

| **[On the Probability of First Success in Differential Evolution: Hazard Identities and Tail Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11499v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study first-hitting times in Differential Evolution (DE) through a conditional hazard frame work. Instead of analyzing convergence via Markov-chain transition kernels or drift arguments, we ex press the survival probability of a measurable target set $A$ as a product of conditional first-hit probabilities (hazards) $p_t=\Prob(E_t\mid\mathcal F_{t-1})$. This yields distribution-free identities for survival and explicit tail bounds whenever deterministic lower bounds on the hazard hold on the survival event. For the L-SHADE algorithm with current-to-$p$best/1 mutation, we construct a checkable algorithmic witness event $\mathcal L_t$ under which the conditional hazard admits an explicit lower bound depending only on sampling rules, population size, and crossover statistics. This separates theoretical constants from empirical event frequencies and explains why worst-case constant-hazard bounds are typically conservative. We complement the theory with a Kaplan--Meier survival analysis on the CEC2017 benchmark suite . Across functions and budgets, we identify three distinct empirical regimes: (i) strongly clustered success, where hitting times concentrate in short bursts; (ii) approximately geometric tails, where a constant-hazard model is accurate; and (iii) intractable cases with no observed hits within the evaluation horizon. The results show that while constant-hazard bounds provide valid tail envelopes, the practical behavior of L-SHADE is governed by burst-like transitions rather than homogeneous per-generati on success probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All codes are publically available at https://github.com/snenovgmailcom/lshade_hazard_project</p></details> |
| **[A Distributed Generative AI Approach for Heterogeneous Multi-Domain Environments under Data Sharing constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12979v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning has gained attention for its ability to enable multiple nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing raw data. At the same time, Generative AI -- particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) -- have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of domains, such as healthcare, security, and Image Generation. However, training generative models typically requires large datasets and significant computational resources, which are often unavailable in real-world settings. Acquiring such resources can be costly and inefficient, especially when many underutilized devices -- such as IoT devices and edge devices -- with varying capabilities remain idle. Moreover, obtaining large datasets is challenging due to privacy concerns and copyright restrictions, as most devices are unwilling to share their data. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach for decentralized GAN training that enables utilizing distributed data and underutilized, low-capability devices while not sharing data in its raw form. Our approach is designed to tackle key challenges in decentralized environments, combining KLD-weighted Clustered Federated Learning to address the issues of data heterogeneity and multi-domain datasets, with Heterogeneous U-Shaped split learning to tackle the challenge of device heterogeneity under strict data sharing constraints -- ensuring that no labels or raw data, whether real or synthetic, are ever shared between nodes. Experiments show that our approach demonstrates significant improvements across key metrics, where it achieves an average 10% boost in classification metrics (up to 60% in multi-domain non-IID settings), 1.1x -- 3x higher image generation scores for the MNIST family datasets, and 2x -- 70x lower FID scores for higher resolution datasets.

| **[A Probabilistic Approach to Trajectory-Based Optimal Experimental Design](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11473v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel probabilistic approach for optimal path experimental design. In this approach a discrete path optimization problem is defined on a static navigation mesh, and trajectories are modeled as random variables governed by a parametric Markov policy. The discrete path optimization problem is then replaced with an equivalent stochastic optimization problem over the policy parameters, resulting in an optimal probability model that samples estimates of the optimal discrete path. This approach enables exploration of the utility function's distribution tail and treats the utility function of the design as a black box, making it applicable to linear and nonlinear inverse problems and beyond experimental design. Numerical verification and analysis are carried out by using a parameter identification problem widely used in model-based optimal experimental design.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 Fi...</summary><p>42 Figures, this version includes supplementary material as appendices</p></details> |
| **[Exploring LLM Features in Predictive Process Monitoring for Small-Scale Event-Logs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11468v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive Process Monitoring is a branch of process mining that aims to predict the outcome of an ongoing process. Recently, it leveraged machine-and-deep learning architectures. In this paper, we extend our prior LLM-based Predictive Process Monitoring framework, which was initially focused on total time prediction via prompting. The extension consists of comprehensively evaluating its generality, semantic leverage, and reasoning mechanisms, also across multiple Key Performance Indicators. Empirical evaluations conducted on three distinct event logs and across the Key Performance Indicators of Total Time and Activity Occurrence prediction indicate that, in data-scarce settings with only 100 traces, the LLM surpasses the benchmark methods. Furthermore, the experiments also show that the LLM exploits both its embodied prior knowledge and the internal correlations among training traces. Finally, we examine the reasoning strategies employed by the model, demonstrating that the LLM does not merely replicate existing predictive methods but performs higher-order reasoning to generate the predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figure, TMIS journal submission</p></details> |
| **[Learning Semantic-Geometric Task Graph-Representations from Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11460v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon manipulation behaviors, particularly in bimanual settings where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry can vary significantly. A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, preprint</p></details> |
| **[Human-AI Alignment of Multimodal Large Language Models with Speech-Language Pathologists in Parent-Child Interactions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05879v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint attention is a critical marker of early social-communicative development, yet remains difficult for caregivers to assess without expert guidance. In this work, we explore how multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can be aligned with the reasoning processes of speech-language pathologists (SLPs) to support the interpretation of everyday parent-child interactions. We conducted in-depth interviews and video annotation studies with three experienced SLPs to uncover how they evaluate joint attention based on three core behavioural cues: gaze, action, and vocalisation. Using these insights, we developed a two-stage MLLM-based system that first extracts fine-grained behavioural descriptions from video segments and then judge joint attention quality using expert-aligned prompts. Our evaluation across 26 parent-child interaction videos shows that MLLMs can achieve up to 85% accuracy in perceptual cue extraction and over 75% average precision in simulating expert judgement. We further propose design guidelines for building MLLM-based behaviour observation-judgement systems that align with SLPs, emphasising the structuring of behavioural cues, the construction of exemplar libraries grounded in expert annotations, and the need to personalise system responses based on developmental stage and neurotypical or atypical presentation. This work provides structured behavioural cues derived from SLP expertise, demonstrates the feasibility of aligning SLPs observation and judgement using MLLMs, and offers practical design guidelines for building aligned systems to support parent-child interaction analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an earlier version of the work released in May 2025.

| **[Indoor Neutral-Host Networks Over Shared Spectrum and Shared Infrastructure: A Comparison Study of Real-World Deployments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11457v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Indoor high-capacity connectivity is frequently constrained by significant building penetration loss and the inherent uplink power limitations of a typical outdoor macro-cell deployment. While Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) must optimize spectrum across low-band (<1 GHz) and mid-band (1-7 GHz) frequencies, uplink performance remains disproportionately degraded due to link budget asymmetry. Neutral-host (NH) networking provides a scalable alternative by transparently offloading MNO subscribers via spectrum sharing and shared infrastructure. We present a multi-site measurement study comparing Citizens Broadband Radio Service (CBRS)-enabled NH networks against public MNO 4G/5G macro deployments and Wi-Fi. Our results show: (i) significant building penetration loss with up to 15.5 dB in low-bands and 17.9 dB in mid-bands, resulting in a ~10 dB RSRP deficit for MNO mid-bands compared to low-bands; (ii) NH networks provide a 30 dB higher median indoor RSRP with indoor NH normalized downlink throughput matches MNO outdoor performance, while its uplink performance exceeds MNO levels in both indoor and outdoor settings; (iii) NH proximity enables superior uplink efficiency, utilizing 64-QAM for 56% of transmissions (versus <6% for MNOs) and reducing median UE transmit power by 5 dB; (iv) MNOs rely on low-band spectrum for indoor uplink transmissions, while the NH deployment maintains high-performance mid-band connectivity; and (v) NH outperforms MNOs in end-to-end throughput but trails Wi-Fi in uplink throughput and latency due to packet routing overhead to the MNO core.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to npj Wireless Technology. 21 pages, 12 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Probabilistic Mission Design for Neuro-Symbolic Unmanned Aircraft Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01439v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) is a growing field that demands accurate and trustworthy models of legal concepts and restrictions for navigating Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS). In addition, any implementation of AAM needs to face the challenges posed by inherently dynamic and uncertain human-inhabited spaces robustly. Nevertheless, the employment of UAS beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) is an endearing task that promises to significantly enhance today's logistics and emergency response capabilities. Hence, we propose Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a novel neuro-symbolic approach to navigating UAS within legal frameworks. ProMis is an interpretable and adaptable system architecture that links uncertain geospatial data and noisy perception with declarative, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) to reason over the agent's state space and its legality. To inform planning with legal restrictions and uncertainty in mind, ProMis yields Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML). These scalar fields quantify the belief that the HPLP is satisfied across the agent's state space. Extending prior work on ProMis' reasoning capabilities and computational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based vision models. Hence, our experiments underpin the application of ProMis with multi-modal input data and how our method applies to many AAM scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.03454</p></details> |
| **[IMS: Intelligent Hardware Monitoring System for Secure SoCs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11447v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the modern Systems-on-Chip (SoC), the Advanced eXtensible Interface (AXI) protocol exhibits security vulnerabilities, enabling partial or complete denial-of-service (DoS) through protocol-violation attacks. The recent countermeasures lack a dedicated real-time protocol semantic analysis and evade protocol compliance checks. This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with <=3% latency overhead, and throughput of >2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency. This demonstrates the feasibility of lightweight, security monitoring for resource-constrained edge environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version is accepted for publication at the Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference (DATE) 2026</p></details> |
| **[When Are Two Scores Better Than One? Investigating Ensembles of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11444v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models now generate high-quality, diverse samples, with an increasing focus on more powerful models. Although ensembling is a well-known way to improve supervised models, its application to unconditional score-based diffusion models remains largely unexplored. In this work we investigate whether it provides tangible benefits for generative modelling. We find that while ensembling the scores generally improves the score-matching loss and model likelihood, it fails to consistently enhance perceptual quality metrics such as FID on image datasets. We confirm this observation across a breadth of aggregation rules using Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo Dropout, on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ. We attempt to explain this discrepancy by investigating possible explanations, such as the link between score estimation and image quality. We also look into tabular data through random forests, and find that one aggregation strategy outperforms the others. Finally, we provide theoretical insights into the summing of score models, which shed light not only on ensembling but also on several model composition techniques (e.g. guidance).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at TMLR.

| **[Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual Spread for Precise Massive Editing in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11441v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit exceptional performance across various domains, yet they face critical safety concerns. Model editing has emerged as an effective approach to mitigate these issues. Existing model editing methods often focus on optimizing an information matrix that blends new and old knowledge. While effective, these approaches can be computationally expensive and may cause conflicts. In contrast, we shift our attention to Hierarchical Orthogonal Residual SprEad of the information matrix, which reduces noisy gradients and enables more stable edits from a different perspective. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method HORSE through a clear theoretical comparison with several popular methods and extensive experiments conducted on two datasets across multiple LLMs. The results show that HORSE maintains precise massive editing across diverse scenarios.

| **[Channel Estimation in MIMO Systems Aided by Microwave Linear Analog Computers (MiLACs)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11438v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Microwave linear analog computers (MiLACs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for future gigantic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, enabling beamforming with greatly reduced hardware and computational cost. However, channel estimation for MiLAC-aided systems remains an open problem. Conventional least squares (LS) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation rely on intensive digital computation, which undermines the benefits offered by MiLACs. In this letter, we propose efficient LS and MMSE channel estimation schemes for MiLAC-aided MIMO systems. By designing training precoders and combiners implemented by MiLACs, both LS and MMSE estimation are performed fully in the analog domain, achieving identical performance to their digital counterparts while significantly reducing computational complexity, transmit RF chains, analog-to-digital/digital-to-analog converters (ADCs/DACs) resolution requirements, and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).

| **[Fisher Scoring for Exact Matérn Covariance Estimation through Stable Smoothness Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11437v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gaussian Random Fields (GRFs) with Matérn covariance functions have emerged as a powerful framework for modeling spatial processes due to their flexibility in capturing different features of the spatial field. However, the smoothness parameter is challenging to estimate using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), which involves evaluating the likelihood based on the full covariance matrix of the GRF, due to numerical instability. Moreover, MLE remains computationally prohibitive for large spatial datasets. To address this challenge, we propose the Fisher-BackTracking (Fisher-BT) method, which integrates the Fisher scoring algorithm with a backtracking line search strategy and adopts a series approximation for the modified Bessel function. This method enables an efficient MLE estimation for spatial datasets using the ExaGeoStat high-performance computing framework. Our proposed method not only reduces the number of iterations and accelerates convergence compared to derivative-free optimization methods but also improves the numerical stability of the smoothness parameter estimation. Through simulations and real-data analysis using a soil moisture dataset covering the Mississippi River Basin, we show that the proposed Fisher-BT method achieves accuracy comparable to existing approaches while significantly outperforming derivative-free algorithms such as BOBYQA and Nelder-Mead in terms of computational efficiency and numerical stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

While numerous drift detection heuristics exist, most lack a dynamical interpretation and provide limited guidance on how retraining decisions should be balanced against operational cost. In this work, we propose an entropy-based retraining framework grounded in nonequilibrium statistical physics. Interpreting drift as probability flow governed by a Fokker-Planck equation, we quantify model-data mismatch using relative entropy and show that its time derivative admits an entropy-balance decomposition featuring a nonnegative entropy production term driven by probability currents. Guided by this theory, we implement an entropy-triggered retraining policy using an exponentially weighted moving-average (EWMA) control statistic applied to a streaming kernel density estimator of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We evaluate this approach across multiple nonstationary data streams. In synthetic, financial, and web-traffic domains, entropy-based retraining achieves predictive performance comparable to frequent retraining while reducing retraining frequency by one to two orders of magnitude. However, in a challenging biomedical ECG setting, the entropy-based trigger underperforms the maximum-frequency baseline, highlighting limitations of feature-space entropy monitoring under complex label-conditional drift.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We focus on hallucinations of answers to questions like: "Which instrument did Glenn Gould play?", but we ask these questions for synthetic entities that are unknown to the model. Surprisingly, we find that medium-size models like Gemma-7B-IT frequently hallucinate, i.e., they have difficulty recognizing that the hallucinated fact is not part of their knowledge. We hypothesize that an important factor in causing these hallucinations is the linearity of the relation: linear relations tend to be stored more abstractly, making it difficult for the LLM to assess its knowledge; the facts of nonlinear relations tend to be stored more directly, making knowledge assessment easier. To investigate this hypothesis, we create SyntHal, a dataset of 6000 synthetic entities for six relations. In our experiments with four models, we determine, for each relation, the hallucination rate on SyntHal and also measure its linearity, using $Δ\cos$. We find a strong correlation ($r \in [.78,.82]$) between relational linearity and hallucination rate, providing evidence for our hypothesis that the underlying storage of triples of a relation is a factor in how well a model can self-assess its knowledge. This finding has implications for how to manage hallucination behavior and suggests new research directions for improving the representation of factual knowledge in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We present a systematic stress-testing framework that probes failure modes of FNOs across five qualitatively different PDE families: dispersive, elliptic, multi-scale fluid, financial, and chaotic systems. Rather than optimizing in-distribution accuracy, we design controlled stress tests--including parameter shifts, boundary or terminal condition changes, resolution extrapolation with spectral analysis, and iterative rollouts--to expose vulnerabilities such as spectral bias, compounding integration errors, and overfitting to restricted boundary regimes. Our large-scale evaluation (1{,}000 trained models) reveals that distribution shifts in parameters or boundary conditions can inflate errors by more than an order of magnitude, while resolution changes primarily concentrate error in high-frequency modes. Input perturbations generally do not amplify error, though worst-case scenarios (e.g., localized Poisson perturbations) remain challenging. These findings provide a comparative failure-mode atlas and actionable insights for improving robustness in operator learning.</p></details> | 17 pages, 8 figures |

Traditional BERT embeddings suffer from anisotropic representation spaces, where course descriptions exhibit high cosine similarities regardless of semantic relevance. To address this limitation, we propose a contrastive learning framework with data augmentation and isotropy regularization that produces more discriminative embeddings. Our system processes student text queries and recommends Top-N relevant courses from a curated dataset of over 500 engineering courses across multiple faculties. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model achieves improved embedding separation and more accurate course recommendations compared to vanilla BERT baselines.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

For example, a driver must perceive the road ahead to anticipate available friction and plan actions accordingly. Achieving such proactive adaptation within autonomous frameworks remains a challenge, particularly under rapidly changing conditions. Traditional modeling approaches often struggle to capture abrupt variations in system behavior, while adaptive methods are inherently reactive and may adapt too late to ensure safety. We propose a vision-conditioned variational Bayesian last-layer dynamics model that leverages visual context to anticipate changes in the environment. The model first learns nominal vehicle dynamics and is then fine-tuned with feature-wise affine transformations of latent features, enabling context-aware dynamics prediction. The resulting model is integrated into an optimal controller for vehicle racing. We validate our method on a Lexus LC500 racing through water puddles. With vision-conditioning, the system completed all 12 attempted laps under varying conditions. In contrast, all baselines without visual context consistently lost control, demonstrating the importance of proactive dynamics adaptation in high-performance applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, currently under review</p></details> |

WH interleaving enables high sampling rate analog-digital conversion with reduced power consumption using an analog WH transformation. We demonstrate that E2E-trained neural coded modulation can transparently adapt to the WH-transceiver hardware without requiring algorithmic redesign. Focusing on the short block length regime, we train WH-domain AEs and benchmark them against standard neural and conventional baselines, including 5G Polar codes. We quantify the system-level energy tradeoffs among baseband compute, channel signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and analog converter power. Our analysis shows that the proposed WH-AE system can approach conventional Polar code SNR performance within 0.14dB while consuming comparable or lower system power. Compared to the best neural baseline, WH-AE achieves, on average, 29% higher energy efficiency (in bit/J) for the same reliability. These findings establish WH-domain learning as a viable path to energy-efficient, high-throughput wideband communications by explicitly balancing compute complexity, SNR, and analog power consumption.</p></details> | 16 pages, 17 figures |

Such conditions are rarely met in real-world scenarios. We present ShapeR, a novel approach for conditional 3D object shape generation from casually captured sequences. Given an image sequence, we leverage off-the-shelf visual-inertial SLAM, 3D detection algorithms, and vision-language models to extract, for each object, a set of sparse SLAM points, posed multi-view images, and machine-generated captions. A rectified flow transformer trained to effectively condition on these modalities then generates high-fidelity metric 3D shapes. To ensure robustness to the challenges of casually captured data, we employ a range of techniques including on-the-fly compositional augmentations, a curriculum training scheme spanning object- and scene-level datasets, and strategies to handle background clutter. Additionally, we introduce a new evaluation benchmark comprising 178 in-the-wild objects across 7 real-world scenes with geometry annotations. Experiments show that ShapeR significantly outperforms existing approaches in this challenging setting, achieving an improvement of 2.7x in Chamfer distance compared to state of the art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: http://facebookresearch.github.io/ShapeR Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbY30KAA55I</p></details> |
| **[Conditional Distribution Compression via the Kernel Conditional Mean Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10139v4)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing distribution compression methods, like Kernel Herding (KH), were originally developed for unlabelled data. However, no existing approach directly compresses the conditional distribution of \textit{labelled} data. To address this gap, we first introduce the Average Maximum Conditional Mean Discrepancy (AMCMD), a metric for comparing conditional distributions, and derive a closed form estimator. Next, we make a key observation: in the context of distribution compression, the cost of constructing a compressed set targeting the AMCMD can be reduced from cubic to linear. Leveraging this, we extend KH to propose Average Conditional Kernel Herding (ACKH), a linear-time greedy algorithm for constructing compressed sets that target the AMCMD. To better understand the advantages of directly compressing the conditional distribution rather than doing so via the joint distribution, we introduce Joint Kernel Herding (JKH), an adaptation of KH designed to compress the joint distribution of labelled data. While herding methods provide a simple and interpretable selection process, they rely on a greedy heuristic. To explore alternative optimisation strategies, we also propose Joint Kernel Inducing Points (JKIP) and Average Conditional Kernel Inducing Points (ACKIP), which jointly optimise the compressed set while maintaining linear complexity. Experiments show that directly preserving conditional distributions with ACKIP outperforms both joint distribution compression and the greedy selection used in ACKH. Moreover, we see that JKIP consistently outperforms JKH.</p></details> | <details><summary>76 pa...</summary><p>76 pages, 32 figures, accepted into NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Semantic-Geometric Task Graph-Representations from Human Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11460v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning structured task representations from human demonstrations is essential for understanding long-horizon manipulation behaviors, particularly in bimanual settings where action ordering, object involvement, and interaction geometry can vary significantly. A key challenge lies in jointly capturing the discrete semantic structure of tasks and the temporal evolution of object-centric geometric relations in a form that supports reasoning over task progression. In this work, we introduce a semantic-geometric task graph-representation that encodes object identities, inter-object relations, and their temporal geometric evolution from human demonstrations. Building on this formulation, we propose a learning framework that combines a Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) encoder with a Transformer-based decoder, decoupling scene representation learning from action-conditioned reasoning about task progression. The encoder operates solely on temporal scene graphs to learn structured representations, while the decoder conditions on action-context to predict future action sequences, associated objects, and object motions over extended time horizons. Through extensive evaluation on human demonstration datasets, we show that semantic-geometric task graph-representations are particularly beneficial for tasks with high action and object variability, where simpler sequence-based models struggle to capture task progression. Finally, we demonstrate that task graph representations can be transferred to a physical bimanual robot and used for online action selection, highlighting their potential as reusable task abstractions for downstream decision-making in manipulation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, preprint</p></details> |

In addition, any implementation of AAM needs to face the challenges posed by inherently dynamic and uncertain human-inhabited spaces robustly. Nevertheless, the employment of UAS beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) is an endearing task that promises to significantly enhance today's logistics and emergency response capabilities. Hence, we propose Probabilistic Mission Design (ProMis), a novel neuro-symbolic approach to navigating UAS within legal frameworks. ProMis is an interpretable and adaptable system architecture that links uncertain geospatial data and noisy perception with declarative, Hybrid Probabilistic Logic Programs (HPLP) to reason over the agent's state space and its legality. To inform planning with legal restrictions and uncertainty in mind, ProMis yields Probabilistic Mission Landscapes (PML). These scalar fields quantify the belief that the HPLP is satisfied across the agent's state space. Extending prior work on ProMis' reasoning capabilities and computational characteristics, we show its integration with potent machine learning models such as Large Language Models (LLM) and Transformer-based vision models. Hence, our experiments underpin the application of ProMis with multi-modal input data and how our method applies to many AAM scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2406.03454</p></details> |

Traditional BERT embeddings suffer from anisotropic representation spaces, where course descriptions exhibit high cosine similarities regardless of semantic relevance. To address this limitation, we propose a contrastive learning framework with data augmentation and isotropy regularization that produces more discriminative embeddings. Our system processes student text queries and recommends Top-N relevant courses from a curated dataset of over 500 engineering courses across multiple faculties. Experimental results demonstrate that our fine-tuned model achieves improved embedding separation and more accurate course recommendations compared to vanilla BERT baselines.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

Using a neural encoder trained exclusively on non-Gaussian instrumental glitches, we perform strict zero-shot anomaly analysis on rolling-element bearings without retraining, fine-tuning, or target-domain labels. On the IMS-NASA run-to-failure dataset, the operator yields a monotonic health index HI(t) = s0.99(t)/tau normalized to an early-life reference distribution, enabling fixed false-alarm monitoring at 1-q = 1e-3 with tau = Q0.999(P0). In discrete fault regimes (CWRU), it achieves strong window-level discrimination (AUC_win about 0.90) and file-level separability approaching unity (AUC_file about 0.99). Electrically dominated vibration signals (VSB) show weak, non-selective behavior, delineating a physical boundary for transfer. Under a matched IMS controlled-split protocol, a generic EfficientNet-B0 encoder pretrained on ImageNet collapses in the intermittent regime (Lambda_tail about 2), while the interferometric operator retains strong extreme-event selectivity (Lambda_tail about 860), indicating that the effect is not a generic property of CNN features. Controlled morphology-destruction transformations selectively degrade performance despite per-window normalization, consistent with sensitivity to coherent time-frequency organization rather than marginal amplitude statistics.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures.

Grounded in content analysis and generalizability theory, we diagnose five variance sources: construct specification, interface effects, model preferences, output extraction, and system-level aggregation. Empirical demonstrations show that minor design choices-prompt phrasing, model selection-can shift outcomes by 12-85 percentage points. Such variance threatens not only reproducibility but econometric identification: annotation errors correlated with covariates bias parameter estimates regardless of average accuracy. We develop a variance-aware protocol specifying sampling budgets, aggregation rules, and reporting standards, and delineate scope conditions where LLM annotation should not be used. These contributions transform LLM-based annotation from ad hoc practice into auditable measurement infrastructure.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages for the main paper 53 pages for appendix</p></details> |

However, this flexibility introduces severe trust challenges, as traditional authentication schemes fail to scale or adapt in decentralized, post-fabrication programmable environments. This paper presents InterPUF, a compact and scalable authentication framework that transforms the interposer into a distributed root of trust. InterPUF embeds a route-based differential delay physically unclonable function (PUF) across the reconfigurable interconnect and secures authentication using multi-party computation (MPC), ensuring raw PUF signatures are never exposed. Our hardware evaluation shows only 0.23% area and 0.072% power overhead across diverse chiplets while preserving authentication latency within tens of nanoseconds. Simulation results using pyPUF confirm strong uniqueness, reliability, and modeling resistance under process, voltage, and temperature variations. By combining interposer-resident PUF primitives with cryptographic hashing and collaborative verification, InterPUF enforces a minimal-trust authentication model without relying on a centralized anchor.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE International Symposium on Hardware Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) 2026</p></details> |

We present DREAM-CL, a novel CL method for ECG arrhythmia detection that introduces dynamic prototype rehearsal memory. DREAM-CL selects representative prototypes by clustering data based on learning behavior during each training session. Within each cluster, we apply a smooth sorting operation that ranks samples by training difficulty, compressing extreme values and removing outliers. The more challenging samples are then chosen as prototypes for the rehearsal memory, ensuring effective knowledge retention across sessions. We evaluate our method on time-incremental, class-incremental, and lead-incremental scenarios using two widely used ECG arrhythmia datasets, Chapman and PTB-XL. The results demonstrate that DREAM-CL outperforms the state-of-the-art in CL for ECG arrhythmia detection. Detailed ablation and sensitivity studies are performed to validate the different design choices of our method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to 2025 International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2025)</p></details> |

By imposing that the reconstruction be amplitude-equivariant, we narrow down the class of admissible functionals to those that can be expressed as a power of a seminorm. We then show that such functionals can be approximated to arbitrary precision with the help of polyhedral norms. In particular, we identify two dual parameterizations of such systems: (i) a synthesis form with an $\ell_1$-penalty that involves some learnable dictionary; and (ii) an analysis form with an $\ell_\infty$-penalty that involves a trainable regularization operator. After having provided geometric insights and proved that the two forms are universal, we propose an implementation that relies on a specific architecture (tight frame with a weighted $\ell_1$ penalty) that is easy to train. We illustrate its use for denoising and the reconstruction of biomedical images. We find that the proposed framework outperforms the sparsity-based methods of compressed sensing, while it offers essentially the same convergence and robustness guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in SIAM Journal on Imaging Sciences</p></details> |

Existing methods either discard valuable information from uncertain samples or force-align every unlabeled sample into one or a few synthetic "catch-all" representations, resulting in geometric collapse and overconfidence on only seen OODs. To address the limitations, we introduce selective non-alignment, adding a novel "skip" operator into conventional pull and push operations of contrastive learning. Our framework, SkipAlign, selectively skips alignment (pulling) for low-confidence unlabeled samples, retaining only gentle repulsion against ID prototypes. This approach transforms uncertain samples into a pure repulsion signal, resulting in tighter ID clusters and naturally dispersed OOD features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SkipAlign significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detecting unseen OOD data without sacrificing ID classification accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (AAAI 2026)</p></details> |

Rather than replacing the cognitive work of users, GenAI systems should be designed to support and scaffold it. Therefore, this paper introduces an LLM-based conversational copilot designed to scaffold information evaluation rather than provide answers and foster digital literacy skills. In a pre-registered, randomised controlled trial (N=261) examining three interface conditions including a chat-based copilot, our mixed-methods analysis reveals that users engaged deeply with the copilot, demonstrating metacognitive reflection. However, the copilot did not significantly improve answer correctness or search engagement, largely due to a "time-on-chat vs. exploration" trade-off and users' bias toward positive information. Qualitative findings reveal tension between the copilot's Socratic approach and users' desire for efficiency. These results highlight both the promise and pitfalls of pedagogical copilots, and we outline design pathways to reconcile literacy goals with efficiency demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-P...</summary><p>Pre-Print accepted at CHIIR 2026</p></details> |

Instead of relying on task-specific models or independent modules for each modality, VINO uses a shared diffusion backbone that conditions on text, images and videos, enabling a broad range of visual creation and editing tasks under one model. Specifically, VINO couples a vision-language model (VLM) with a Multimodal Diffusion Transformer (MMDiT), where multimodal inputs are encoded as interleaved conditioning tokens, and then used to guide the diffusion process. This design supports multi-reference grounding, long-form instruction following, and coherent identity preservation across static and dynamic content, while avoiding modality-specific architectural components. To train such a unified system, we introduce a multi-stage training pipeline that progressively expands a video generation base model into a unified, multi-task generator capable of both image and video input and output. Across diverse generation and editing benchmarks, VINO demonstrates strong visual quality, faithful instruction following, improved reference and attribute preservation, and more controllable multi-identity edits. Our results highlight a practical path toward scalable unified visual generation, and the promise of interleaved, in-context computation as a foundation for general-purpose visual creation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://sotamak1r.github.io/VINO-web/</p></details> |

The optimal trade-off is shown to be governed by a mutual information term involving common information and two conditional rate-distortion-perception functions. The perception constraint requires that the distribution of each reproduced sequence is close to that of the original source sequence, which is motivated by practical applications in image and video compression. Prior studies usually focus on the compression and reconstruction of a single source sequence. In this paper, we generalize the prior results for point-to-point systems to the representative multi-terminal setting of the Gray-Wyner problem with two correlated source sequences. In particular, we integrate the analyses of the distortion and the perception constraints by including the random circular shift operator in the encoding and decoding process directly.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT) 2026.

Therefore, this paper introduces $\textbf{$T^2$-RAGBench}$, a benchmark comprising $\textbf{23,088}$ question-context-answer triples, designed to evaluate RAG methods on real-world text-and-table data. Unlike typical QA datasets that operate under $\textit{Oracle Context}$ settings, $\textbf{$T^2$-RAGBench}$ challenges models to first retrieve the correct context before conducting numerical reasoning. Existing QA datasets containing text-and-table data typically contain context-dependent questions, which may yield multiple correct answers depending on the provided context. To address this, we transform SOTA datasets into a context-independent format, validated by experts as 91.3% context-independent questions, enabling reliable RAG evaluation. Our comprehensive evaluation identifies $\textit{Hybrid BM25}$ , a technique that combines dense and sparse vectors, as the most effective approach for text-and-table data. However, results demonstrate that $\textbf{$T^2$-RAGBench}$ remains challenging even for SOTA LLMs and RAG methods. Further ablation studies examine the impact of embedding models and corpus size on retrieval performance. $\textbf{$T^2$-RAGBench}$ provides a realistic and rigorous benchmark for existing RAG methods on text-and-table data.

We present DDAIR (Disambiguated Data Augmentation for Intent Recognition) to mitigate this problem. We use Sentence Transformers to detect ambiguous class-guided augmented examples generated by LLMs for intent recognition in low-resource scenarios. We identify synthetic examples that are semantically more similar to another intent than to their target one. We also provide an iterative re-generation method to mitigate such ambiguities. Our findings show that sentence embeddings effectively help to (re)generate less ambiguous examples, and suggest promising potential to improve classification performance in scenarios where intents are loosely or broadly defined.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at EACL 2026</p></details> |

This is a challenging problem, as the stochastic nature of wildfire evolution requires the seamless integration of sensing, estimation, and control, often treated separately in existing methods. State-of-the-art methods either impose linear-Gaussian assumptions to establish optimality or rely on approximations and heuristics, often without providing explicit performance guarantees. To address these limitations, we formulate the fire front monitoring task as a stochastic optimal control problem that integrates sensing, estimation, and control. We derive an optimal recursive Bayesian estimator for a class of stochastic nonlinear elliptical-growth fire front models. Subsequently, we transform the resulting nonlinear stochastic control problem into a finite-horizon Markov decision process and design an information-seeking predictive control law obtained via a lower confidence bound-based adaptive search algorithm with asymptotic convergence to the optimal policy.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 IEEE 64th Conference on Decision and Control (CDC)</p></details> |

While automated systems can flag hate speech with high accuracy, they often function as "black boxes" that fail to provide the granular, interpretable evidence, such as precise timestamps and target identities, required for effective human-in-the-loop moderation. In this work, we introduce TANDEM, a unified framework that transforms audio-visual hate detection from a binary classification task into a structured reasoning problem. Our approach employs a novel tandem reinforcement learning strategy where vision-language and audio-language models optimize each other through self-constrained cross-modal context, stabilizing reasoning over extended temporal sequences without requiring dense frame-level supervision. Experiments across three benchmark datasets demonstrate that TANDEM significantly outperforms zero-shot and context-augmented baselines, achieving 0.73 F1 in target identification on HateMM (a 30% improvement over state-of-the-art) while maintaining precise temporal grounding. We further observe that while binary detection is robust, differentiating between offensive and hateful content remains challenging in multi-class settings due to inherent label ambiguity and dataset imbalance. More broadly, our findings suggest that structured, interpretable alignment is achievable even in complex multimodal settings, offering a blueprint for the next generation of transparent and actionable online safety moderation tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at ICWSM 2026</p></details> |

Linear attention reduces the cost to O(N), yet its compressed state representations can impair modeling capacity and accuracy. We present an analytical study that contrasts linear and softmax attention for visual representation learning from a layer-stacking perspective. We further conduct systematic experiments on layer-wise hybridization patterns of linear and softmax attention. Our results show that, compared with rigid intra-block hybrid designs, fine-grained layer-wise hybridization can match or surpass performance while requiring fewer softmax layers. Building on these findings, we propose SoLA-Vision (Softmax-Linear Attention Vision), a flexible layer-wise hybrid attention backbone that enables fine-grained control over how linear and softmax attention are integrated. By strategically inserting a small number of global softmax layers, SoLA-Vision achieves a strong trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. On ImageNet-1K, SoLA-Vision outperforms purely linear and other hybrid attention models. On dense prediction tasks, it consistently surpasses strong baselines by a considerable margin.

This work identifies a core bottleneck: the prevailing ``LLM+CL'' paradigm focuses on semantic alignment but cannot perform knowledge acquisition, leading to failures on specialized terminology. To bridge this gap, we propose Learn Before Represent (LBR), a novel two-stage framework. LBR first injects domain knowledge via an Information Bottleneck-Constrained Generative Learning stage, preserving the LLM's causal attention to maximize knowledge acquisition while compressing semantics. It then performs Generative-Refined Contrastive Learning on the compressed representations for alignment. This approach maintains architectural consistency and resolves the objective conflict between generative and contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on medical, chemistry, and code retrieval tasks show that LBR significantly outperforms strong baselines. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building accurate and robust representations in vertical domains.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

However, these methods often suffer from suboptimal graph structures, particularly due to sparse connections at boundary points and noisy connections in junction areas. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method that integrates a graph smoothing module with an enhanced local geometry learning module. Specifically, we identify the limitations of conventional graph structures, particularly in handling boundary points and junction areas. In response, we introduce a graph smoothing module designed to optimize the graph structure and minimize the negative impact of unreliable sparse and noisy connections. Based on the optimized graph structure, we improve the feature extract function with local geometry information. These include shape features derived from adaptive geometric descriptors based on eigenvectors and distribution features obtained through cylindrical coordinate transformation. Experimental results on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of our method in various point cloud learning tasks, i.e., classification, part segmentation, and semantic segmentation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Our model, Onomas-CNN X, combines parallel convolution branches with depthwise-separable operations and hierarchical classification to process names efficiently on CPU hardware. We evaluate the architecture on a large multilingual dataset covering 104 languages and four entity types (person, organization, location, other). Onomas-CNN X achieves 92.1% accuracy while processing 2,813 names per second on a single CPU core - 46 times faster than fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa with comparable accuracy. The model reduces energy consumption by a factor of 46 compared to transformer baselines. Our experiments demonstrate that specialized CNN architectures remain competitive with large pre-trained models for focused NLP tasks when sufficient training data exists.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of paper presented at ISAI-NLP Phukat 2025</p></details> |
| **[Spurious Rewards Paradox: Mechanistically Understanding How RLVR Activates Memorization Shortcuts in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11061v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is highly effective for enhancing LLM reasoning, yet recent evidence shows models like Qwen 2.5 achieve significant gains even with spurious or incorrect rewards. We investigate this phenomenon and identify a "Perplexity Paradox": spurious RLVR triggers a divergence where answer-token perplexity drops while prompt-side coherence degrades, suggesting the model is bypassing reasoning in favor of memorization. Using Path Patching, Logit Lens, JSD analysis, and Neural Differential Equations, we uncover a hidden Anchor-Adapter circuit that facilitates this shortcut. We localize a Functional Anchor in the middle layers (L18-20) that triggers the retrieval of memorized solutions, followed by Structural Adapters in later layers (L21+) that transform representations to accommodate the shortcut signal. Finally, we demonstrate that scaling specific MLP keys within this circuit allows for bidirectional causal steering-artificially amplifying or suppressing contamination-driven performance. Our results provide a mechanistic roadmap for identifying and mitigating data contamination in RLVR-tuned models.

| **[NanoSD: Edge Efficient Foundation Model for Real Time Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09823v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Latent diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion 1.5 offer strong generative priors that are highly valuable for image restoration, yet their full pipelines remain too computationally heavy for deployment on edge devices. Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2026</p></details> |

This makes modifying such models for tasks such as pruning or unlearning, which are constrained by this unavailability, an active area of research. Existing techniques typically require gradients or ground-truth labels, rendering them infeasible in settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we investigate the fundamental question of identifying components that are critical to the model's predictive performance, without access to either gradients or the loss function, and with only distributional access such as synthetic data. We theoretically demonstrate that the global error is linearly bounded by local reconstruction errors for Lipschitz-continuous networks such as CNNs and well-trained Transformers (which, contrary to existing literature, we find exhibit Lipschitz continuity). This motivates using the locally reconstructive behavior of component subsets to quantify their global importance, via a metric that we term Subset Fidelity. In the uncorrelated features setting, selecting individual components based on their Subset Fidelity scores is optimal, which we utilize to propose ModHiFi, an algorithm for model modification that requires neither training data nor access to a loss function. ModHiFi-P, for structured pruning, achieves an 11\% speedup over the current state of the art on ImageNet models and competitive performance on language models. ModHiFi-U, for classwise unlearning, achieves complete unlearning on CIFAR-10 without fine-tuning and demonstrates competitive performance on Swin Transformers.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 (Spotlight).

While recent techniques leverage saliency or transformer attention, they merely address global context of the video signal by using static maps as auxiliary inputs rather than embedding context fundamentally within feature extraction of the video sequence. We present Dynamic Attention with Global Registers for Video Quality Assessment (DAGR-VQA), the first framework integrating register-token directly into a convolutional backbone for spatio-temporal, dynamic saliency prediction. By embedding learnable register tokens as global context carriers, our model enables dynamic, HVS-inspired attention, producing temporally adaptive saliency maps that track salient regions over time without explicit motion estimation. Our model integrates dynamic saliency maps with RGB inputs, capturing spatial data and analyzing it through a temporal transformer to deliver a perceptually consistent video quality assessment. Comprehensive tests conducted on the LSVQ, KonVid-1k, LIVE-VQC, and YouTube-UGC datasets show that the performance is highly competitive, surpassing the majority of top baselines. Research on ablation studies demonstrates that the integration of register tokens promotes the development of stable and temporally consistent attention mechanisms. Achieving an efficiency of 387.7 FPS at 1080p, DAGR-VQA demonstrates computational performance suitable for real-time applications like multimedia streaming systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACM MMSys 2026. 12 pages, 8 figures.

| **[Beyond Feature Mapping GAP: Integrating Real HDRTV Priors for Superior SDRTV-to-HDRTV Conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10775v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of HDR-WCG display devices has highlighted the need to convert SDRTV to HDRTV, as most video sources are still in SDR. Existing methods primarily focus on designing neural networks to learn a single-style mapping from SDRTV to HDRTV. However, the limited information in SDRTV and the diversity of styles in real-world conversions render this process an ill-posed problem, thereby constraining the performance and generalization of these methods. Inspired by generative approaches, we propose a novel method for SDRTV to HDRTV conversion guided by real HDRTV priors. Despite the limited information in SDRTV, introducing real HDRTV as reference priors significantly constrains the solution space of the originally high-dimensional ill-posed problem. This shift transforms the task from solving an unreferenced prediction problem to making a referenced selection, thereby markedly enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the conversion process. Specifically, our approach comprises two stages: the first stage employs a Vector Quantized Generative Adversarial Network to capture HDRTV priors, while the second stage matches these priors to the input SDRTV content to recover realistic HDRTV outputs. We evaluate our method on public datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness with significant improvements in both objective and subjective metrics across real and synthetic datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IJCAI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bid Farewell to Seesaw: Towards Accurate Long-tail Session-based Recommendation via Dual Constraints of Hybrid Intents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08378v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Session-based recommendation (SBR) aims to predict anonymous users' next interaction based on their interaction sessions. In the practical recommendation scenario, low-exposure items constitute the majority of interactions, creating a long-tail distribution that severely compromises recommendation diversity. Existing approaches attempt to address this issue by promoting tail items but incur accuracy degradation, exhibiting a "see-saw" effect between long-tail and accuracy performance. We attribute such conflict to session-irrelevant noise within the tail items, which existing long-tail approaches fail to identify and constrain effectively. To resolve this fundamental conflict, we propose \textbf{HID} (\textbf{H}ybrid \textbf{I}ntent-based \textbf{D}ual Constraint Framework), a plug-and-play framework that transforms the conventional "see-saw" into "win-win" through introducing the hybrid intent-based dual constraints for both long-tail and accuracy. Two key innovations are incorporated in this framework: (i) \textit{Hybrid Intent Learning}, where we reformulate the intent extraction strategies by employing attribute-aware spectral clustering to reconstruct the item-to-intent mapping. Furthermore, discrimination of session-irrelevant noise is achieved through the assignment of the target and noise intents to each session. (ii) \textit{Intent Constraint Loss}, which incorporates two novel constraint paradigms regarding the \textit{diversity} and \textit{accuracy} to regulate the representation learning process of both items and sessions. These two objectives are unified into a single training loss through rigorous theoretical derivation. Extensive experiments across multiple SBR models and datasets demonstrate that HID can enhance both long-tail performance and recommendation accuracy, establishing new state-of-the-art performance in long-tail recommender systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI 2026 Oral</p></details> |
| **[A Quantum-Driven Evolutionary Framework for Solving High-Dimensional Sharpe Ratio Portfolio Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11029v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-dimensional portfolio optimization faces significant computational challenges under complex constraints, with traditional optimization methods struggling to balance convergence speed and global exploration capability. To address this, firstly, we introduce an enhanced Sharpe ratio-based model that incorporates all constraints into the objective function using adaptive penalty terms, transforming the original constrained problem into an unconstrained single-objective formulation. This approach preserves financial interpretability while simplifying algorithmic implementation. To efficiently solve the resulting high-dimensional optimization problem, we propose a Quantum Hybrid Differential Evolution (QHDE) algorithm, which integrates Quantum-inspired probabilistic behavior into the standard DE framework. QHDE employs a Schrodinger-inspired probabilistic mechanism for population evolution, enabling more flexible and diversified solution updates. To further enhance performance, a good point set-chaos reverse learning strategy is adopted to generate a well-dispersed initial population, and a dynamic elite pool combined with Cauchy-Gaussian hybrid perturbations strengthens global exploration and mitigates premature convergence. Experimental validation on CEC benchmarks and real-world portfolios involving 20 to 80 assets demonstrates that QHDE's performance improves by up to 73.4%. It attains faster convergence, higher solution precision, and greater robustness than seven state-of-the-art counterparts, thereby confirming its suitability for complex, high-dimensional portfolio optimization and advancing quantum-inspired evolutionary research in computational finance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Mingy...</summary><p>Mingyang Yu and Jiaqi Zhang contributed equally</p></details> |

A Deep Dive into Whole vs. Individual Modalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07399v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal recommendation has emerged as a mainstream paradigm, typically leveraging text and visual embeddings extracted from pre-trained models such as Sentence-BERT, Vision Transformers, and ResNet. This approach is founded on the intuitive assumption that incorporating multimodal embeddings can enhance recommendation performance. However, despite its popularity, this assumption lacks comprehensive empirical verification. This presents a critical research gap. To address it, we pose the central research question of this paper: Are multimodal embeddings truly beneficial for recommendation? To answer this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical study examining the role of text and visual embeddings in modern multimodal recommendation models, both as a whole and individually. Specifically, we pose two key research questions: (1) Do multimodal embeddings as a whole improve recommendation performance? (2) Is each individual modality - text and image - useful when used alone? To isolate the effect of individual modalities - text or visual - we employ a modality knockout strategy by setting the corresponding embeddings to either constant values or random noise. To ensure the scale and comprehensiveness of our study, we evaluate 14 widely used state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation models. Our findings reveal that: (1) multimodal embeddings generally enhance recommendation performance - particularly when integrated through more sophisticated graph-based fusion models. Surprisingly, commonly adopted baseline models with simple fusion schemes, such as VBPR and BM3, show only limited gains. (2) The text modality alone achieves performance comparable to the full multimodal setting in most cases, whereas the image modality alone does not. These results offer foundational insights and practical guidance for the multimodal recommendation community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECIR 2026</p></details> |

However, the role of these retrieval heads in improving model performance remains unexplored. This work investigates whether retrieval heads can be leveraged to enhance the long-context capabilities of LLMs. Specifically, we propose RetMask, a method that generates training signals by contrasting normal model outputs with those from an ablated variant in which the retrieval heads are masked. This mechanism-based approach achieves substantial improvements: +2.28 points on HELMET at 128K for Llama-3.1, with +70% gains on generation with citation and +32% on passage re-ranking, while preserving performance on general tasks. Experiments across three model families reveal that the effectiveness depends on retrieval head organization: models with concentrated patterns of retrieval heads respond strongly, while those with distributed patterns show limited gains. This mechanistic relationship validates the function of retrieval heads and demonstrates that mechanistic insights can be transformed into performance enhancements.</p></details> | 13 pages |

The recent countermeasures lack a dedicated real-time protocol semantic analysis and evade protocol compliance checks. This paper tackles this AXI vulnerability issue and presents an intelligent hardware monitoring system (IMS) for real-time detection of AXI protocol violations. IMS is a hardware module leveraging neural networks to achieve high detection accuracy. For model training, we perform DoS attacks through header-field manipulation and systematic malicious operations, while recording AXI transactions to build a training dataset. We then deploy a quantization-optimized neural network, achieving 98.7% detection accuracy with <=3% latency overhead, and throughput of >2.5 million inferences/s. We subsequently integrate this IMS into a RISC-V SoC as a memory-mapped IP core to monitor its AXI bus. For demonstration and initial assessment for later ASIC integration, we implemented this IMS on an AMD Zynq UltraScale+ MPSoC ZCU104 board, showing an overall small hardware footprint (9.04% look-up-tables (LUTs), 0.23% DSP slices, and 0.70% flip-flops) and negligible impact on the overall design's achievable frequency. This demonstrates the feasibility of lightweight, security monitoring for resource-constrained edge environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The f...</summary><p>The final version is accepted for publication at the Design, Automation & Test in Europe Conference (DATE) 2026</p></details> |

Our approach uses two autoencoders, one for the parameter space and one for the observation space, connected by learned mappings between the autoencoders' latent spaces. These mappings enable a surrogate for regularized inversion and optimization in low-dimensional, informative latent spaces. Our flexible framework can work with partial, noisy, or out-of-distribution data, all while maintaining consistency with the underlying physical models. The paired autoencoders enable reconstruction of corrupted data, and then use the reconstructed data for parameter estimation, which produces more accurate reconstructions compared to paired autoencoders alone and end-to-end encoder-decoders of the same architecture, especially in scenarios with data inconsistencies. We demonstrate our approaches on two imaging examples in medical tomography and geophysical seismic-waveform inversion, but the described approaches are broadly applicable to a variety of inverse problems in scientific and engineering applications.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |

However, their performance on long-form videos remains limited by computational constraints and suboptimal frame selection. We present Think-Clip-Sample (TCS), a training-free framework that enhances long video understanding through two key components: (i) Multi-Query Reasoning, which generates multiple queries to capture complementary aspects of the question and video; and (ii) Clip-level Slow-Fast Sampling, which adaptively balances dense local details and sparse global context. Extensive experiments on MLVU, LongVideoBench, and VideoMME demonstrate that TCS consistently improves performance across different MLLMs, boosting up to 6.9% accuracy, and is capable of achieving comparable accuracy with 50% fewer inference time cost, highlighting both efficiency and efficacy of TCS on long video understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICASSP2026</p></details> |
| **[Multivector Reranking in the Era of Strong First-Stage Retrievers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05200v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned multivector representations power modern search systems with strong retrieval effectiveness, but their real-world use is limited by the high cost of exhaustive token-level retrieval. Therefore, most systems adopt a \emph{gather-and-refine} strategy, where a lightweight gather phase selects candidates for full scoring. However, this approach requires expensive searches over large token-level indexes and often misses the documents that would rank highest under full similarity. In this paper, we reproduce several state-of-the-art multivector retrieval methods on two publicly available datasets, providing a clear picture of the current multivector retrieval field and observing the inefficiency of token-level gathering. Building on top of that, we show that replacing the token-level gather phase with a single-vector document retriever -- specifically, a learned sparse retriever (LSR) -- produces a smaller and more semantically coherent candidate set. This recasts the gather-and-refine pipeline into the well-established two-stage retrieval architecture. As retrieval latency decreases, query encoding with two neural encoders becomes the dominant computational bottleneck. To mitigate this, we integrate recent inference-free LSR methods, demonstrating that they preserve the retrieval effectiveness of the dual-encoder pipeline while substantially reducing query encoding time. Finally, we investigate multiple reranking configurations that balance efficiency, memory, and effectiveness, and we introduce two optimization techniques that prune low-quality candidates early. Empirical results show that these techniques improve retrieval efficiency by up to 1.8$\times$ with no loss in quality. Overall, our two-stage approach achieves over $24\times$ speedup over the state-of-the-art multivector retrieval systems, while maintaining comparable or superior retrieval quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 2 figures, ECIR 2026</p></details> |

In this report, we present an integrated safety evaluation of six frontier models--GPT-5.2, Gemini 3 Pro, Qwen3-VL, Grok 4.1 Fast, Nano Banana Pro, and Seedream 4.5--assessing each across language, vision-language, and image generation using a unified protocol that combines benchmark, adversarial, multilingual, and compliance evaluations. By aggregating results into safety leaderboards and model profiles, we reveal a highly uneven safety landscape: while GPT-5.2 demonstrates consistently strong and balanced performance, other models exhibit clear trade-offs across benchmark safety, adversarial robustness, multilingual generalization, and regulatory compliance. Despite strong results under standard benchmarks, all models remain highly vulnerable under adversarial testing, with worst-case safety rates dropping below 6%. Text-to-image models show slightly stronger alignment in regulated visual risk categories, yet remain fragile when faced with adversarial or semantically ambiguous prompts. Overall, these findings highlight that safety in frontier models is inherently multidimensional--shaped by modality, language, and evaluation design--underscoring the need for standardized, holistic safety assessments to better reflect real-world risk and guide responsible deployment.</p></details> | 41 pages, 22 figures |

Network-level analysis and long-term observation of publicly available transactions can often be used to infer user identities. To mitigate this, several blockchain applications rely on relayers, which serve as intermediary nodes between users and smart contracts deployed on the blockchain. However, dependence on a single relayer not only creates a single point of failure but also introduces exploitable vulnerabilities that weaken the system's privacy guarantees. This paper proposes a decentralized relayer architecture that enhances privacy and reliability through game-theoretic incentive design. We model the interaction among relayers as a non-cooperative game and design an incentive mechanism in which probabilistic uploading emerges as a unique mixed Nash equilibrium. Using evolutionary game analysis, we demonstrate the equilibrium's stability against perturbations and coordinated deviations. Through numerical evaluations, we analyze how equilibrium strategies and system behavior evolve with key parameters such as the number of relayers, upload costs, rewards, and penalties. In particular, we show that even with high transaction costs, the system maintains reliability with an outage probability below 0.05 . Furthermore, our results highlight a fundamental trade-off between privacy, reliability, robustness, and cost in decentralized relayer systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

As systems evolve toward automation, models must operate on edge devices (e.g., PLCs, microcontrollers) with strict constraints on latency and memory, limiting parameters to a few thousand. Conventional deep architectures are often impractical here. We propose the Fourier-Efficient Adaptive Temporal Hierarchy Forecaster (FEATHer) for accurate long-term forecasting under severe limits. FEATHer introduces: (i) ultra-lightweight multiscale decomposition into frequency pathways; (ii) a shared Dense Temporal Kernel using projection-depthwise convolution-projection without recurrence or attention; (iii) frequency-aware branch gating that adaptively fuses representations based on spectral characteristics; and (iv) a Sparse Period Kernel reconstructing outputs via period-wise downsampling to capture seasonality. FEATHer maintains a compact architecture (as few as 400 parameters) while outperforming baselines. Across eight benchmarks, it achieves the best ranking, recording 60 first-place results with an average rank of 2.05. These results demonstrate that reliable long-range forecasting is achievable on constrained edge hardware, offering a practical direction for industrial real-time inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence (TPAMI)</p></details> |

Our approach is based on a self-normalizing technique and avoids the estimation of the asymptotic variances of the empirical autocovariances. We provide pivotal confidence intervals for the (R)FPE, develop estimates for the minimal order of a linear prediction that is required to obtain a prespecified forecasting accuracy and also propose (pivotal) statistical tests for the hypotheses that the (R)FPE exceeds a given threshold. Additionally, we provide pivotal uncertainty quantification for the commonly used coefficient of determination $R^2$ obtained from a linear prediction based on the past $p \geq 1$ observations and develop new (pivotal) inference tools for the partial autocorrelation, which do not require the assumption of an autoregressive process.</p></details> | 34, pages, 3 figures |

In such settings, the focus is on identifying infrequent but significant events with high reliability and accuracy, while also extracting fine-grained details and assessing recognition quality. In this paper, we propose an approach that integrates VLMs with traditional computer vision methods through explicit logic reasoning to enhance SA in three key ways: (a) extracting fine-grained event details, (b) employing an intelligent fine-tuning (FT) strategy that achieves substantially higher accuracy than uninformed selection, and (c) generating justifications for VLM outputs during inference. We demonstrate that our intelligent FT mechanism improves the accuracy and provides a valuable means, during inferencing, to either confirm the validity of the VLM output or indicate why it may be questionable.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on AI</p></details> |

Yet, learning effectively from tabular data in few-shot settings, where labeled examples are scarce, remains a fundamental challenge. Traditional tree-based methods often falter in these regimes due to their reliance on statistical purity metrics, which become unstable and prone to overfitting with limited supervision. At the same time, direct applications of large language models (LLMs) often overlook its inherent structure, leading to suboptimal performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose FORESTLLM, a novel framework that unifies the structural inductive biases of decision forests with the semantic reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Crucially, FORESTLLM leverages the LLM only during training, treating it as an offline model designer that encodes rich, contextual knowledge into a lightweight, interpretable forest model, eliminating the need for LLM inference at test time. Our method is two-fold. First, we introduce a semantic splitting criterion in which the LLM evaluates candidate partitions based on their coherence over both labeled and unlabeled data, enabling the induction of more robust and generalizable tree structures under few-shot supervision. Second, we propose a one-time in-context inference mechanism for leaf node stabilization, where the LLM distills the decision path and its supporting examples into a concise, deterministic prediction, replacing noisy empirical estimates with semantically informed outputs. Across a diverse suite of few-shot classification and regression benchmarks, FORESTLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | 23 pages |

While existing NVS methods tend to overfit when processing limited input views, advanced few-shot NVS methods are computationally intensive and perform sub-optimally in remote sensing scenes. This paper presents TriDF, an efficient hybrid 3D representation for fast remote sensing NVS from as few as 3 input views. Our approach decouples color and volume density information, modeling them independently to reduce the computational burden on implicit radiance fields and accelerate reconstruction. We explore the potential of the triplane representation in few-shot NVS tasks by mapping high-frequency color information onto this compact structure, and the direct optimization of feature planes significantly speeds up convergence. Volume density is modeled as continuous density fields, incorporating reference features from neighboring views through image-based rendering to compensate for limited input data. Additionally, we introduce depth-guided optimization based on point clouds, which effectively mitigates the overfitting problem in few-shot NVS. Comprehensive experiments across multiple remote sensing scenes demonstrate that our hybrid representation achieves a 30x speed increase compared to NeRF-based methods, while simultaneously improving rendering quality metrics over advanced few-shot methods (7.4% increase in PSNR and 3.4% in SSIM).

State-of-the-art approaches have largely focused on harmonic and melodic features, employing increasingly complex audio pipelines designed to be invariant to musical attributes that often vary widely across covers. While effective, these methods demand substantial training time and computational resources. By contrast, lyrics constitute a strong invariant across covers, though their use has been limited by the difficulty of extracting them accurately and efficiently from polyphonic audio. Early methods relied on simple frameworks that limited downstream performance, while more recent systems deliver stronger results but require large models integrated within complex multimodal architectures. We introduce LIVI (Lyrics-Informed Version Identification), an approach that seeks to balance retrieval accuracy with computational efficiency. First, LIVI leverages supervision from state-of-the-art transcription and text embedding models during training to achieve retrieval accuracy on par with--or superior to--harmonic-based systems. Second, LIVI remains lightweight and efficient by removing the transcription step at inference, challenging the dominance of complexity-heavy pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ECIR 2026 (European Conference of Information Retrieval)</p></details> |
| **[Multi-task Neural Diffusion Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03419v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural diffusion processes provide a scalable, non-Gaussian approach to modelling distributions over functions, but existing formulations are limited to single-task inference and do not capture dependencies across related tasks. In many multi-task regression settings, jointly modelling correlated functions and enabling task-aware conditioning is crucial for improving predictive performance and uncertainty calibration, particularly in low-data regimes. We propose multi-task neural diffusion processes, an extension that incorporates a task encoder to enable task-conditioned probabilistic regression and few-shot adaptation across related functions. The task encoder extracts a low-dimensional representation from context observations and conditions the diffusion model on this representation, allowing information sharing across tasks while preserving input-size agnosticity and the equivariance properties of neural diffusion processes. The resulting framework retains the expressiveness and scalability of neural diffusion processes while enabling efficient transfer to unseen tasks. Empirical results demonstrate improved point prediction accuracy and better-calibrated predictive uncertainty compared to single-task neural diffusion processes and Gaussian process baselines. We validate the approach on real wind farm data appropriate for wind power prediction. In this high-impact application, reliable uncertainty quantification directly supports operational decision-making in wind farm management, illustrating effective few-shot adaptation in a challenging real-world multi-task regression setting.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 12 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This article proposes a likelihood-based approach for estimating ergodicity transformations that addresses such challenges. The method is broadly compatible with standard models, including Gaussian processes, ARMA, and GARCH. A detailed simulation study using geometric and arithmetic Brownian motion demonstrates the ability of the approach to recover known ergodicity transformations.

Unlike the traditional avatar method, which requires a studio-level multi-view capture system and reconstructs a human-specific model through a long-time optimization process, we rethink the task through the lenses of model representation, network design, and data preparation. First, we introduce a UV-guided avatar modeling strategy, in which each input image is associated with a pixel-wise facial correspondence estimation. Such correspondence estimation allows us to reproject each valid pixel color from screen space to UV space, which is independent of camera pose and character expression. Furthermore, we design learnable UV tokens on which the attention mechanism can be applied at both the screen and UV levels. The learned UV tokens can be decoded into canonical Gaussian attributes using aggregated UV information from all input views. To train our large avatar model, we additionally prepare a large-scale, identity-rich synthetic training dataset. Our method significantly outperforms existing approaches in both monocular and multi-view settings.

| **[Context-aware Graph Causality Inference for Few-Shot Molecular Property Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11135v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular property prediction is becoming one of the major applications of graph learning in Web-based services, e.g., online protein structure prediction and drug discovery. A key challenge arises in few-shot scenarios, where only a few labeled molecules are available for predicting unseen properties. Recently, several studies have used in-context learning to capture relationships among molecules and properties, but they face two limitations in: (1) exploiting prior knowledge of functional groups that are causally linked to properties and (2) identifying key substructures directly correlated with properties. We propose CaMol, a context-aware graph causality inference framework, to address these challenges by using a causal inference perspective, assuming that each molecule consists of a latent causal structure that determines a specific property. First, we introduce a context graph that encodes chemical knowledge by linking functional groups, molecules, and properties to guide the discovery of causal substructures. Second, we propose a learnable atom masking strategy to disentangle causal substructures from confounding ones. Third, we introduce a distribution intervener that applies backdoor adjustment by combining causal substructures with chemically grounded confounders, disentangling causal effects from real-world chemical variations. Experiments on diverse molecular datasets showed that CaMol achieved superior accuracy and sample efficiency in few-shot tasks, showing its generalizability to unseen properties. Also, the discovered causal substructures were strongly aligned with chemical knowledge about functional groups, supporting the model interpretability.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Revisiting Lower Bounds for Two-Step Consensus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03627v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A seminal result by Lamport shows that at least $\max\{2e+f+1,2f+1\}$ processes are required to implement partially synchronous consensus that tolerates $f$ process failures and can furthermore decide in two message delays under $e$ failures. This lower bound is matched by the classical Fast Paxos protocol. However, more recent practical protocols, such as Egalitarian Paxos, provide two-step decisions with fewer processes, seemingly contradicting the lower bound. We show that this discrepancy arises because the classical bound requires two-step decisions under a wide range of scenarios, not all of which are relevant in practice. We propose a more pragmatic condition for which we establish tight bounds on the number of processes required. Interestingly, these bounds depend on whether consensus is implemented as an atomic object or a decision task. For consensus as an object, $\max\{2e+f-1,2f+1\}$ processes are necessary and sufficient for two-step decisions, while for a task the tight bound is $\max\{2e+f, 2f+1\}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of a paper in the 2025 ACM Symposium on Principles of Distributed Computing (PODC)</p></details> |

Unfortunately, this approach makes the leader a single point of failure and increases the latency for clients that are not co-located with it. As a response to these drawbacks, Egalitarian Paxos introduced an alternative, leaderless approach, that allows replicas to order commands collaboratively. Not relying on a single leader allows the protocol to maintain non-zero throughput with up to $f$ crashes of any processes out of a total of $n = 2f+1$. The protocol furthermore allows any process to execute a command $c$ fast, in $2$ message delays, provided no more than $e = \lceil\frac{f+1}{2}\rceil$ other processes fail, and all concurrently submitted commands commute with $c$; the latter condition is often satisfied in practical systems. Egalitarian Paxos has served as a foundation for many other replication protocols. But unfortunately, the protocol is very complex, ambiguously specified and suffers from nontrivial bugs. In this paper, we present EPaxos* -- a simpler and correct variant of Egalitarian Paxos. Our key technical contribution is a simpler failure-recovery algorithm, which we have rigorously proved correct. Our protocol also generalizes Egalitarian Paxos to cover the whole spectrum of failure thresholds $f$ and $e$ such that $n \ge \max\{2e+f-1, 2f+1\}$ -- the number of processes that we show to be optimal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of a paper in OPODIS'25: International Conference on Principles of Distributed Systems</p></details> |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference for Computationally Expensive Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08683v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) -- a framework that combines surrogate modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.</p></details> | 27 pages, 15 figures |

Toxic trades are predicted with a novel online learning Bayesian method which we call the projection-based unification of last-layer and subspace estimation (PULSE). PULSE is a fast and statistically-efficient Bayesian procedure for online training of neural networks. We employ a proprietary dataset of foreign exchange transactions to test our methodology. Neural networks trained with PULSE outperform standard machine learning and statistical methods when predicting if a trade will be toxic; the benchmark methods are logistic regression, random forests, and a recursively-updated maximum-likelihood estimator. We devise a strategy for the broker who uses toxicity predictions to internalise or to externalise each trade received from her clients. Our methodology can be implemented in real-time because it takes less than one millisecond to update parameters and make a prediction. Compared with the benchmarks, online learning of a neural network with PULSE attains the highest PnL and avoids the most losses by externalising toxic trades.</p></details> | 27 pages, 18 figures |

We adapt SAM 2.1 for pose-guided segmentation with minimal encoder modifications, retaining its strong generalization. Using a fine-tuning strategy called PoseMaskRefine, we incorporate pose keypoints with high visibility into the iterative correction process originally employed by SAM, yielding improved robustness and accuracy across multiple datasets. During inference, we simplify prompting by selecting only the three keypoints with the highest visibility. This strategy reduces sensitivity to common errors, such as missing body parts or misclassified clothing, and allows accurate mask prediction from as few as a single keypoint. Our results demonstrate that pose-guided fine-tuning of SAM enables effective, occlusion-aware human segmentation while preserving the generalization capabilities of the original model.

| **[Cascading multi-agent anomaly detection in surveillance systems via vision-language models and embedding-based classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06204v3)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intelligent anomaly detection in dynamic visual environments requires reconciling real-time performance with semantic interpretability. Conventional approaches address only fragments of this challenge. Reconstruction-based models capture low-level deviations without contextual reasoning, object detectors provide speed but limited semantics, and large vision-language systems deliver interpretability at prohibitive computational cost. This work introduces a cascading multi-agent framework that unifies these complementary paradigms into a coherent and interpretable architecture. Early modules perform reconstruction-gated filtering and object-level assessment, while higher-level reasoning agents are selectively invoked to interpret semantically ambiguous events. The system employs adaptive escalation thresholds and a publish-subscribe communication backbone, enabling asynchronous coordination and scalable deployment across heterogeneous hardware. Extensive evaluation on large-scale monitoring data demonstrates that the proposed cascade achieves a threefold reduction in latency compared to direct vision-language inference, while maintaining high perceptual fidelity (PSNR = 38.3 dB, SSIM = 0.965) and consistent semantic labeling. The framework advances beyond conventional detection pipelines by combining early-exit efficiency, adaptive multi-agent reasoning, and explainable anomaly attribution, establishing a reproducible and energy-efficient foundation for scalable intelligent visual monitoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author email changed, Acknowlegement changes</p></details> |

Process mining is increasingly investigating fairness. There is a growing area focusing on fairness-aware algorithms. So far, we know less how these concepts perform on empirical healthcare data or how they cover aspects of justice theory. This study addresses this research problem and proposes a process mining approach to assess fairness in triage by linking real-life event logs with conceptual dimensions of justice. Using the MIMICEL event log (as derived from MIMIC-IV ED), we analyze time, re-do, deviation and decision as process outcomes, and evaluate the influence of age, gender, race, language and insurance using the Kruskal-Wallis, Chi-square and effect size measurements. These outcomes are mapped to justice dimensions to support the development of a conceptual framework. The results demonstrate which aspects of potential unfairness in high-acuity and sub-acute surface. In this way, this study contributes empirical insights that support further research in responsible, fairness-aware process mining in healthcare.</p></details> | conference |

Existing lightweight variants predominantly compress the denoising U-Net or reduce the diffusion trajectory, which disrupts the underlying latent manifold and limits generalization beyond a single task. We introduce NanoSD, a family of Pareto-optimal diffusion foundation models distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5 through network surgery, feature-wise generative distillation, and structured architectural scaling jointly applied to the U-Net and the VAE encoder-decoder. This full-pipeline co-design preserves the generative prior while producing models that occupy distinct operating points along the accuracy-latency-size frontier (e.g., 130M-315M parameters, achieving real-time inference down to 20ms on mobile-class NPUs). We show that parameter reduction alone does not correlate with hardware efficiency, and we provide an analysis revealing how architectural balance, feature routing, and latent-space preservation jointly shape true on-device latency. When used as a drop-in backbone, NanoSD enables state-of-the-art performance across image super-resolution, image deblurring, face restoration, and monocular depth estimation, outperforming prior lightweight diffusion models in both perceptual quality and practical deployability. NanoSD establishes a general-purpose diffusion foundation model family suitable for real-time visual generation and restoration on edge devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CVPR 2026</p></details> |

However, it exhibits significant quality degradation -- manifested as spatial blur and temporal inconsistency -- under challenging scenarios characterized by limited camera motion or large outpainting regions, where inter-frame information is limited. We identify the cause as a training-inference mismatch in the masking strategy: M3DDM's training applies random mask directions and widths across frames, whereas inference requires consistent directional outpainting throughout the video. To address this, we propose M3DDM+, which applies uniform mask direction and width across all frames during training, followed by fine-tuning of the pretrained M3DDM model. Experiments demonstrate that M3DDM+ substantially improves visual fidelity and temporal coherence in information-limited scenarios while maintaining computational efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/tamaki-lab/M3DDM-Plus.</p></details> | proc. of IWAIT2026 |

In such settings, producing useful partial solutions quickly is often more practical than exhaustive reasoning, which incurs high inference costs. Many real-world tasks, such as trip planning, require models to deliver the best possible output within a fixed reasoning budget. We introduce an anytime reasoning framework and the Anytime Index, a metric that quantifies how effectively solution quality improves as reasoning tokens increase. To further enhance efficiency, we propose an inference-time self-improvement method using LLM-synthesized preference data, where models learn from their own reasoning comparisons to produce better intermediate solutions. Experiments on NaturalPlan (Trip), AIME, and GPQA datasets show consistent gains across Grok-3, GPT-oss, GPT-4.1/4o, and LLaMA models, improving both reasoning quality and efficiency under budget constraints.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Causal Inference under Threshold Manipulation: Bayesian Mixture Modeling and Heterogeneous Treatment Effects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19814v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many marketing applications, including credit card incentive programs, offer rewards to customers who exceed specific spending thresholds to encourage increased consumption. Quantifying the causal effect of these thresholds on customers is crucial for effective marketing strategy design. Although regression discontinuity design is a standard method for such causal inference tasks, its assumptions can be violated when customers, aware of the thresholds, strategically manipulate their spending to qualify for the rewards. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework for estimating the causal effect under threshold manipulation. The main idea is to model the observed spending distribution as a mixture of two distributions: one representing customers strategically affected by the threshold, and the other representing those unaffected. To fit the mixture model, we adopt a two-step Bayesian approach consisting of modeling non-bunching customers and fitting a mixture model to a sample around the threshold. We show posterior contraction of the resulting posterior distribution of the causal effect under large samples. Furthermore, we extend this framework to a hierarchical Bayesian setting to estimate heterogeneous causal effects across customer subgroups, allowing for stable inference even with small subgroup sample sizes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods through simulation studies and illustrate their practical implications using a real-world marketing dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

We show that when personalized LLMs face factual queries, there exists a phenomenon where the model generates answers aligned with a user's prior history rather than the objective truth, resulting in personalization-induced hallucinations that degrade factual reliability and may propagate incorrect beliefs, due to representational entanglement between personalization and factual representations. To address this issue, we propose Factuality-Preserving Personalized Steering (FPPS), a lightweight inference-time approach that mitigates personalization-induced factual distortions while preserving personalized behavior. We further introduce PFQABench, the first benchmark designed to jointly evaluate factual and personalized question answering under personalization. Experiments across multiple LLM backbones and personalization methods show that FPPS substantially improves factual accuracy while maintaining personalized performance.</p></details> | 20 pages, 15 figures |

Rather than treating sparse reconstruction as a regression task, we recast it as a hierarchical probabilistic inference problem, where uncertainty is explicitly represented, structured, and progressively resolved. From this perspective, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing) as a general reconstruction paradigm for multi-scale physical fields under extreme data sparsity. Central to this paradigm is the introduction of an explicit intermediate representation that decomposes the original ill-posed problem into two substantially better-conditioned subproblems. First, a lightweight neural-operator-based functional autoencoder infers a coarse-scale approximation of the target field from sparse observations acting as an explicit intermediate variable. Rather than modeling multiple scales jointly, this intermediate estimate is deterministically fixed and subsequently used as the sole conditioning input to a conditional diffusion model that generates refined-scale details, yielding a cascaded inference structure with clearly separated reconstruction responsibilities. To ensure robustness under diverse sensing patterns, the diffusion model is trained using a mask-cascade strategy, which exposes it to a distribution of imperfect conditioning structures induced by extreme sparsity. During inference, measurement consistency is enforced through manifold-constrained gradients within a Bayesian posterior framework, ensuring fidelity to sparse observations while preserving data manifold coherence. This cascaded probabilistic formulation substantially alleviates ill-posedness, enabling accurate and stable reconstructions even under extreme sparsity.</p></details> | 20 pages,13 figures |

Prior work primarily aims to mitigate forgetting during adaptation; however, forgetting often remains inevitable during this process. We introduce a novel paradigm, continued fine-tuning (CFT), which seeks to recover pretrained knowledge after a zero-shot model has already been adapted. We propose a simple, model-agnostic CFT strategy (named MERGETUNE) guided by linear mode connectivity (LMC), which can be applied post hoc to existing fine-tuned models without requiring architectural changes. Given a fine-tuned model, we continue fine-tuning its trainable parameters (e.g., soft prompts or linear heads) to search for a continued model which has two low-loss paths to the zero-shot (e.g., CLIP) and the fine-tuned (e.g., CoOp) solutions. By exploiting the geometry of the loss landscape, the continued model implicitly merges the two solutions, restoring pretrained knowledge lost in the fine-tuned counterpart. A challenge is that the vanilla LMC constraint requires data replay from the pretraining task. We approximate this constraint for the zero-shot model via a second-order surrogate, eliminating the need for large-scale data replay. Experiments show that MERGETUNE improves the harmonic mean of CoOp by +5.6% on base-novel generalisation without adding parameters. On robust fine-tuning evaluations, the LMC-merged model from MERGETUNE surpasses ensemble baselines with lower inference cost, achieving further gains and state-of-the-art results when ensembled with the zero-shot model. Our code is available at https://github.com/Surrey-UP-Lab/MERGETUNE.</p></details> | 20 pages, 5 figures |

However, their computational cost becomes prohibitive for repeated queries and large-scale 3D scenarios. Recent purely data-driven networks improve efficiency, yet they often bypass this scattering mechanism, which may compromise physical consistency and generalization. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose U-PINet, a fully end-to-end, physics-informed hierarchical network for efficient RCS prediction via 3D electromagnetic scattering reconstruction. Once the scattering quantities are reconstructed, scattered fields and RCS can be evaluated for arbitrary observation directions via the radiation integral. U-PINet explicitly learns physics-consistent intermediate scattering representations by modeling local electromagnetic coupling and long-range radiation effects through a hierarchical operator design inspired by near-far field decomposition in fast solvers. A physics-guided graph neural network is incorporated to capture self- and mutual-coupling among mesh elements of complex targets, enabling physically interpretable intermediate representations. By embedding governing equations as residual constraints, U-PINet enables accurate object reconstruction of scattering quantities and consequently reliable RCS prediction across observation directions, while significantly reducing runtime. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that U-PINet achieves EM-solver-level RCS accuracy and 3D object reconstruction with orders-of-magnitude speedups, and generalizes well to unseen geometries under limited training data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to an IEEE Transactions Journal</p></details> |

Current steering methods, such as prompting-based and activation-based approaches, are widely used to guide model behavior. However, activation-based techniques require deep access to internal layers, while prompting-based steering often fails to provide consistent or fine-grained control. In order to address these limitations, we propose a training-free inference-time logit intervention for controllable generation. Our approach utilizes a statistical token score table derived from z-normalized log-odds of labeled corpora to shift the decoding distribution. Empirical evaluations across three diverse datasets focusing on writing complexity, formality, and toxicity demonstrate that our method effectively steers output characteristics, confirming its broad applicability and task-agnostic nature. Our results show that statistically grounded logit steering can achieve large, consistent, and multi-task control gains: up to +47%p accuracy and 50x f1 improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 5 figures, preprint</p></details> |
