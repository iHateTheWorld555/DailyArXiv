| **[Stream-DiffVSR: Low-Latency Streamable Video Super-Resolution via Auto-Regressive Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23709v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion-based video super-resolution (VSR) methods achieve strong perceptual quality but remain impractical for latency-sensitive settings due to reliance on future frames and expensive multi-step denoising. We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

| **[Training AI Co-Scientists Using Rubric Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23707v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages in the main paper, total 119 including sample outputs in the Appendix</p></details> |
| **[Diffusion Knows Transparency: Repurposing Video Diffusion for Transparent Object Depth and Normal Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23705v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transparent objects remain notoriously hard for perception systems: refraction, reflection and transmission break the assumptions behind stereo, ToF and purely discriminative monocular depth, causing holes and temporally unstable estimates. Our key observation is that modern video diffusion models already synthesize convincing transparent phenomena, suggesting they have internalized the optical rules. We build TransPhy3D, a synthetic video corpus of transparent/reflective scenes: 11k sequences rendered with Blender/Cycles. Scenes are assembled from a curated bank of category-rich static assets and shape-rich procedural assets paired with glass/plastic/metal materials. We render RGB + depth + normals with physically based ray tracing and OptiX denoising. Starting from a large video diffusion model, we learn a video-to-video translator for depth (and normals) via lightweight LoRA adapters. During training we concatenate RGB and (noisy) depth latents in the DiT backbone and co-train on TransPhy3D and existing frame-wise synthetic datasets, yielding temporally consistent predictions for arbitrary-length input videos. The resulting model, DKT, achieves zero-shot SOTA on real and synthetic video benchmarks involving transparency: ClearPose, DREDS (CatKnown/CatNovel), and TransPhy3D-Test. It improves accuracy and temporal consistency over strong image/video baselines, and a normal variant sets the best video normal estimation results on ClearPose. A compact 1.3B version runs at ~0.17 s/frame. Integrated into a grasping stack, DKT's depth boosts success rates across translucent, reflective and diffuse surfaces, outperforming prior estimators. Together, these results support a broader claim: "Diffusion knows transparency." Generative video priors can be repurposed, efficiently and label-free, into robust, temporally coherent perception for challenging real-world manipulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://daniellli.github.io/projects/DKT/; Code: https://github.com/Daniellli/DKT; Dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/Daniellesry/TransPhy3D</p></details> |
| **[Robo-Dopamine: General Process Reward Modeling for High-Precision Robotic Manipulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23703v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The primary obstacle for applying reinforcement learning (RL) to real-world robotics is the design of effective reward functions. While recently learning-based Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising direction, they are often hindered by two fundamental limitations: their reward models lack step-aware understanding and rely on single-view perception, leading to unreliable assessments of fine-grained manipulation progress; and their reward shaping procedures are theoretically unsound, often inducing a semantic trap that misguides policy optimization. To address these, we introduce Dopamine-Reward, a novel reward modeling method for learning a general-purpose, step-aware process reward model from multi-view inputs. At its core is our General Reward Model (GRM), trained on a vast 3,400+ hour dataset, which leverages Step-wise Reward Discretization for structural understanding and Multi-Perspective Reward Fusion to overcome perceptual limitations. Building upon Dopamine-Reward, we propose Dopamine-RL, a robust policy learning framework that employs a theoretically-sound Policy-Invariant Reward Shaping method, which enables the agent to leverage dense rewards for efficient self-improvement without altering the optimal policy, thereby fundamentally avoiding the semantic trap. Extensive experiments across diverse simulated and real-world tasks validate our approach. GRM achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in reward assessment, and Dopamine-RL built on GRM significantly improves policy learning efficiency. For instance, after GRM is adapted to a new task in a one-shot manner from a single expert trajectory, the resulting reward model enables Dopamine-RL to improve the policy from near-zero to 95% success with only 150 online rollouts (approximately 1 hour of real robot interaction), while retaining strong generalization across tasks.

| **[OpenPBR: Novel Features and Implementation Details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23696v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OpenPBR is a physically based, standardized uber-shader developed for interoperable material authoring and rendering across VFX, animation, and design visualization workflows. This document serves as a companion to the official specification, offering deeper insight into the model's development and more detailed implementation guidance, including code examples and mathematical derivations. We begin with a description of the model's formal structure and theoretical foundations - covering slab-based layering, statistical mixing, and microfacet theory - before turning to its physical components. These include metallic, dielectric, subsurface, and glossy-diffuse base substrates, followed by thin-film iridescence, coat, and fuzz layers. A special-case mode for rendering thin-walled objects is also described. Additional sections explore technical topics in greater depth, such as the decoupling of specular reflectivity from transmission, the choice of parameterization for subsurface scattering, and the detailed physics of coat darkening and thin-film interference. We also discuss planned extensions, including hazy specular reflection and retroreflection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Part ...</summary><p>Part of Physically Based Shading in Theory and Practice, SIGGRAPH 2025 Course</p></details> |
| **[PROFASR-BENCH: A Benchmark for Context-Conditioned ASR in High-Stakes Professional Speech](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23686v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) in professional settings faces challenges that existing benchmarks underplay: dense domain terminology, formal register variation, and near-zero tolerance for critical entity errors. We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.

| **[Edge of Stochastic Stability: Revisiting the Edge of Stability for SGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20553v5)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent findings by Cohen et al., 2021, demonstrate that when training neural networks using full-batch gradient descent with a step size of $η$, the largest eigenvalue $λ_{\max}$ of the full-batch Hessian consistently stabilizes around $2/η$. These results have significant implications for convergence and generalization. This, however, is not the case for mini-batch optimization algorithms, limiting the broader applicabilityof the consequences of these findings. We show mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) trains in a different regime we term Edge of Stochastic Stability (EoSS). In this regime, what stabilizes at $2/η$ is Batch Sharpness: the expected directional curvature of mini-batch Hessians along their corresponding stochastic gradients. As a consequence $λ_{\max}$ -- which is generally smaller than Batch Sharpness -- is suppressed, aligning with the long-standing empirical observation that smaller batches and larger step sizes favor flatter minima. We further discuss implications for mathematical modeling of SGD trajectories.</p></details> | 83 pages, 36 figures |
| **[Web World Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23676v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language agents increasingly require persistent worlds in which they can act, remember, and learn. Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

| **[Coarse Q-learning in Decision-Making: Indifference vs. Indeterminacy vs. Instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09321v3)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Coarse Q-learning (CQL), a reinforcement learning model of decision-making under payoff uncertainty where alternatives are exogenously partitioned into coarse similarity classes (based on limited salience) and the agent maintains estimates (valuations) of expected payoffs only at the class level. Choices are modeled as softmax (multinomial logit) over class valuations and uniform within class; and valuations update toward realized payoffs as in classical Q-learning with stochastic bandit feedback (Watkins and Dayan, 1992). Using stochastic approximation, we derive a continuous-time ODE limit of CQL dynamics and show that its steady states coincide with smooth (logit) perturbations of Valuation Equilibria (Jehiel and Samet, 2007). We demonstrate the possibility of multiple equilibria in decision trees with generic payoffs and establish local asymptotic stability of strict pure equilibria whenever they exist. By contrast, we provide sufficient conditions on the primitives under which every decision tree admits a unique, globally asymptotically stable mixed equilibrium that renders the agent indifferent across classes as sensitivity to payoff differences diverges. Nevertheless, convergence to equilibrium is not universal: we construct an open set of decision trees where the unique mixed equilibrium is linearly unstable and the valuations converge to a stable limit cycle - with choice probabilities perpetually oscillating.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 Ma...</summary><p>45 Main pages + 25 Appendix pages</p></details> |
| **[End-to-End Test-Time Training for Long Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23675v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/test-time-training/e2e</p></details> |
| **[IDT: A Physically Grounded Transformer for Feed-Forward Multi-View Intrinsic Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23667v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.</p></details> | 10 pages 4 figures |

An algorithm designer typically seeks to provide guarantees about their proposed algorithm -- for example, that its running time or space complexity is upper-bounded as a certain function of its input size. They may also wish to determine the necessary properties of the quantities derived by the algorithm to synthesize efficient data structures and verify type errors. In this paper, we develop a system for helping programmers to perform these types of analyses. We apply our system to a number of NLP algorithms and find that it successfully infers types, dead and redundant code, and parametric runtime and space complexity bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>2021 ...</summary><p>2021 manuscript; accepted by TACL but not revised for publication</p></details> |

We present a lightweight toolkit with three parts: (1) Victor Calibration (VC), a multi-pass protocol that elicits a scalar confidence proxy T (T0<T1<T2) through iterative evidence re-evaluation; (2) FD-Lite, a behavior-only phenomenology audit with a fixed anchor phrase and a meta-prefix trap to avoid anthropomorphic claims; and (3) CP4.3, a governance stress test for rank invariance and allocation monotonicity (M6). Across Claude 4.5 models (Haiku, Sonnet no-thinking, Sonnet thinking) and Opus, we observe monotonic VC trajectories without violating safety invariants, and stable CP4.3 behavior. ("Opus" here refers to a single Claude Opus 4.1 session accessed via a standard UI account, as reported in Table 1.) This work was conducted by a single operator (n=1) and is intended as hypothesis-generating; we explicitly invite replication, critique, and extension by the research community.

| **[OmniAgent: Audio-Guided Active Perception Agent for Omnimodal Audio-Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23646v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Omnimodal large language models have made significant strides in unifying audio and visual modalities; however, they often lack the fine-grained cross-modal understanding and have difficulty with multimodal alignment. To address these limitations, we introduce OmniAgent, a fully audio-guided active perception agent that dynamically orchestrates specialized tools to achieve more fine-grained audio-visual reasoning. Unlike previous works that rely on rigid, static workflows and dense frame-captioning, this paper demonstrates a paradigm shift from passive response generation to active multimodal inquiry. OmniAgent employs dynamic planning to autonomously orchestrate tool invocation on demand, strategically concentrating perceptual attention on task-relevant cues. Central to our approach is a novel coarse-to-fine audio-guided perception paradigm, which leverages audio cues to localize temporal events and guide subsequent reasoning. Extensive empirical evaluations on three audio-video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that OmniAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source and proprietary models by substantial margins of 10% - 20% accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Websi...</summary><p>Website:https://kd-tao.github.io/OmniAgent/</p></details> |
| **[A Dataset and Benchmark for Consumer Healthcare Question Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23637v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The quest for seeking health information has swamped the web with consumers health-related questions. Generally, consumers use overly descriptive and peripheral information to express their medical condition or other healthcare needs, contributing to the challenges of natural language understanding. One way to address this challenge is to summarize the questions and distill the key information of the original question. Recently, large-scale datasets have significantly propelled the development of several summarization tasks, such as multi-document summarization and dialogue summarization. However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media. We benchmark the dataset on multiple state-of-the-art summarization models to show the effectiveness of the dataset</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2206.06581</p></details> |
| **[NashOpt -- A Python Library for Computing Generalized Nash Equilibria](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23636v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>NashOpt is an open-source Python library for computing and designing generalized Nash equilibria (GNEs) in noncooperative games with shared constraints and real-valued decision variables. The library exploits the joint Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of all players to handle both general nonlinear GNEs and linear-quadratic games, including their variational versions. Nonlinear games are solved via nonlinear least-squares formulations, relying on JAX for automatic differentiation. Linear-quadratic GNEs are reformulated as mixed-integer linear programs, enabling efficient computation of multiple equilibria. The framework also supports inverse-game and Stackelberg game-design problems. The capabilities of NashOpt are demonstrated through several examples, including noncooperative game-theoretic control problems of linear quadratic regulation and model predictive control.

| **[Rethinking the Spatio-Temporal Alignment of End-to-End 3D Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23635v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatio-temporal alignment is crucial for temporal modeling of end-to-end (E2E) perception in autonomous driving (AD), providing valuable structural and textural prior information. Existing methods typically rely on the attention mechanism to align objects across frames, simplifying the motion model with a unified explicit physical model (constant velocity, etc.). These approaches prefer semantic features for implicit alignment, challenging the importance of explicit motion modeling in the traditional perception paradigm. However, variations in motion states and object features across categories and frames render this alignment suboptimal. To address this, we propose HAT, a spatio-temporal alignment module that allows each object to adaptively decode the optimal alignment proposal from multiple hypotheses without direct supervision. Specifically, HAT first utilizes multiple explicit motion models to generate spatial anchors and motion-aware feature proposals for historical instances. It then performs multi-hypothesis decoding by incorporating semantic and motion cues embedded in cached object queries, ultimately providing the optimal alignment proposal for the target frame. On nuScenes, HAT consistently improves 3D temporal detectors and trackers across diverse baselines. It achieves state-of-the-art tracking results with 46.0% AMOTA on the test set when paired with the DETR3D detector. In an object-centric E2E AD method, HAT enhances perception accuracy (+1.3% mAP, +3.1% AMOTA) and reduces the collision rate by 32%. When semantics are corrupted (nuScenes-C), the enhancement of motion modeling by HAT enables more robust perception and planning in the E2E AD.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Joint Modeling of Longitudinal and Survival Data: A Bayesian Approach for Predicting Disease Progression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23627v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Joint modeling of longitudinal and survival data has become increasingly important in medical research, particularly for understanding disease progression in chronic conditions where both repeated biomarker measurements and time-to-event outcomes are available. Traditional two-stage methods, which analyze longitudinal and survival components separately, often result in biased estimates and suboptimal predictions due to failure to account for their interdependence. In this study, we propose a Bayesian hierarchical joint modeling framework with an emphasis on predictive evaluation and clinical interpretability. The model simultaneously characterizes the longitudinal trajectory of a biomarker and the associated survival outcome through shared random effects, capturing the intrinsic association between disease dynamics and event risk. The Bayesian formulation allows flexible incorporation of prior information, accommodates irregular measurement times and missing data, and provides full posterior distributions for uncertainty quantification via credible intervals. We evaluate the proposed framework using both simulated data designed to mimic realistic patient trajectories and a real-world clinical dataset involving patients with chronic liver disease. Results demonstrate that the Bayesian joint model consistently outperforms conventional two-stage approaches in terms of parameter estimation accuracy and predictive performance, as measured by time-dependent area under the curve and Brier scores. The proposed approach provides a robust and interpretable tool for dynamic, patient-specific prognosis, supporting clinical decision-making in personalized medicine.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

Yet inference remains challenging because the likelihood is often intractable. We show that, for a broad class of growing network models, information about model parameters is localized in the network, i.e., the likelihood can be expressed in terms of small subgraphs. We take a Bayesian perspective to inference and develop neural density estimators (NDEs) to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters using graph neural networks (GNNs) with limited receptive size, i.e., the GNN can only "see" small subgraphs. We characterize nine growing network models in terms of their localization and demonstrate that localization predictions agree with NDEs on simulated data. Even for non-localized models, NDEs can infer high-fidelity posteriors matching model-specific inference methods at a fraction of the cost. Our findings establish information localization as a fundamental property of network growth, theoretically justifying the analysis of local subgraphs embedded in larger, unobserved networks and the use of GNNs with limited receptive field for likelihood-free inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

These rules are motivated, in part, by the belief that explanations can promote recourse by revealing information that decision subjects can use to contest or overturn their predictions. In practice, companies provide individuals with a list of principal reasons based on feature importance derived from methods like SHAP and LIME. In this work, we show how common practices can fail to provide recourse and propose to highlight features based on their responsiveness -- the probability that a decision subject can attain a target prediction through an arbitrary intervention on the feature. We develop efficient methods to compute responsiveness scores for any model and actionability constraints. We show that standard practices in lending can undermine decision subjects by highlighting unresponsive features and explaining predictions that are fixed.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures in body, ICLR 2025, Extended Version</p></details> |

As a result, collaborative robots, despite their advanced sensing and control capabilities, are rarely used for surface finishing in small-scale craft and manufacturing settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing. Throughout the programming process, users receive continuous visual feedback on the robot's learned model, enabling them to iteratively refine the segmentation result. Based on the segmented surface model, a robot trajectory is generated to cover the desired processing area. We evaluated multiple interaction designs across two comprehensive user studies to derive an optimal interface that significantly reduces user workload, improves usability and enables effective task programming even for users with limited practical experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at Intelligent Service Robotics</p></details> |

Despite the long-standing recognition of ontology versioning (OV) as a crucial component of efficient ontology management, many approaches treat OV as similar to ontology matching (OM) and directly reuse OM systems for OV tasks. In this study, we systematically analyse similarities and differences between OM and OV and formalise the OM4OV pipeline to offer more advanced OV support. The pipeline is implemented and evaluated in the state-of-the-art OM system Agent-OM. The experimental results indicate that OM systems can be reused for OV tasks, but without necessary extensions, the current OM4OV pipeline can produce skewed measurements, poor performance in detecting update entities, and limited explainability of false mappings. To tackle these issues, we propose an optimisation method called the cross-reference (CR) mechanism, which builds on existing OM alignments to reduce the number of matching candidates and to improve overall OV performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

We introduce a novel method for realistic post-capture refocusing using video diffusion models. From a single defocused image, our approach generates a perceptually accurate focal stack, represented as a video sequence, enabling interactive refocusing and unlocking a range of downstream applications. We release a large-scale focal stack dataset acquired under diverse real-world smartphone conditions to support this work and future research. Our method consistently outperforms existing approaches in both perceptual quality and robustness across challenging scenarios, paving the way for more advanced focus-editing capabilities in everyday photography.

This is an important problem for network communication, and it has been extensively studied in the sequential settingand recently in the distributed CONGEST model. However, no prior DSO results tailored to the parallel setting were known. We present the first PRAM algorithms to construct DSOs in directed weighted graphs, that can answer a query in $O(1)$ time with a single processor after preprocessing. We also present the first work-optimal PRAM algorithms for other graph problems that belong to the sequential $\tilde{O}(mn)$ fine-grained complexity class: Replacement Paths, Second Simple Shortest Path, All Pairs Second Simple Shortest Paths and Minimum Weight Cycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended abstract appeared in SPAA 2025</p></details> |

This paper introduces a hybrid framework that enhances SPC by integrating the distribution free, model agnostic guarantees of Conformal Prediction. We propose two novel applications: Conformal-Enhanced Control Charts, which visualize process uncertainty and enable proactive signals like 'uncertainty spikes', and Conformal-Enhanced Process Monitoring, which reframes multivariate control as a formal anomaly detection problem using an intuitive p-value chart. Our framework provides a more robust and statistically rigorous approach to quality control while maintaining the interpretability and ease of use of classic methods.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

However, LLMs are fundamentally limited by the ``Artificial Hivemind'' effect, where they generate similar responses within the same model and produce homogeneous outputs across different models. As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.</p></details> | Preprint |

Our results in part can be regarded as an extension of the clustering-based approach to Boolean square matrix multiplication due to Arslan and Chidri (CSC 2011). First, we provide a simple and efficient deterministic algorithm for approximate matrix product of 0-1 matrices, where the additive error is proportional to the minimum maximum radius in an $\ell$-center clustering of the rows of the first matrix or an $k$-center clustering of the columns of the second matrix. Next, we use the approximation algorithm as a preprocessing after which a query asking for the exact value of an arbitrary entry in the product matrix can be answered in time proportional to the additive error. As a consequence, we obtain a simple deterministic algorithm for the exact matrix product of 0-1 matrices. We also present an improved simple deterministic algorithm for the exact product and in addition, faster analogous randomized algorithms for an approximate and the exact matrix products of 0-1 matrices based on randomized $\ell$ and $k$-center clustering.</p></details> | <details><summary>A pre...</summary><p>A preliminary version of this article appeared in Proceedings of Frontiers of Algorithmics - the 19th International Joint Conference (IJTCS-FAW~2025), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, Vol.~15828, pp.~92--102, Springer~Nature, 2025</p></details> |

Enhancing Visual Perception in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23592v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at broad visual understanding but remain coarse-grained, exhibit visual biases, and miss subtle visual details. Existing training corpora reinforce this limitation by emphasizing general recognition ("Is it a cat or a dog?") over fine-grained perception. To address this, we introduce a new training corpus and task designed to enhance the perceptual abilities of VLMs. TWIN is a large-scale dataset of 561,000 image-pair queries that task models to determine whether two visually similar images depict the same object, encouraging attention to nuanced visual cues. The dataset spans a diverse range of everyday objects across contexts, viewpoints, and appearances. Fine-tuning VLMs on TWIN yields notable gains in fine-grained recognition, even on unseen domains such as art, animals, plants, and landmarks. To quantify these gains, we introduce FGVQA, a benchmark suite of 12,000 queries that repurposes fine-grained recognition and retrieval datasets from multiple domains. While existing VLMs struggle on FGVQA, when fine-tuned on TWIN they improve by up to 19.3%, without compromising performance on general VQA benchmarks. Finally, our TWIN dataset scales favorably with object annotations, and our analysis shows that scale is key to performance. We envision TWIN as a drop-in addition to open-source VLM training corpora, advancing perceptual precision of future models.

| **[End-to-End Test-Time Training for Long Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23675v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We formulate long-context language modeling as a problem in continual learning rather than architecture design. Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/test-time-training/e2e</p></details> |
| **[IDT: A Physically Grounded Transformer for Feed-Forward Multi-View Intrinsic Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23667v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic image decomposition is fundamental for visual understanding, as RGB images entangle material properties, illumination, and view-dependent effects. Recent diffusion-based methods have achieved strong results for single-view intrinsic decomposition; however, extending these approaches to multi-view settings remains challenging, often leading to severe view inconsistency. We propose \textbf{Intrinsic Decomposition Transformer (IDT)}, a feed-forward framework for multi-view intrinsic image decomposition. By leveraging transformer-based attention to jointly reason over multiple input images, IDT produces view-consistent intrinsic factors in a single forward pass, without iterative generative sampling. IDT adopts a physically grounded image formation model that explicitly decomposes images into diffuse reflectance, diffuse shading, and specular shading. This structured factorization separates Lambertian and non-Lambertian light transport, enabling interpretable and controllable decomposition of material and illumination effects across views. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that IDT achieves cleaner diffuse reflectance, more coherent diffuse shading, and better-isolated specular components, while substantially improving multi-view consistency compared to prior intrinsic decomposition methods.</p></details> | 10 pages 4 figures |
| **[Timepoint-Specific Benchmarking of Deep Learning Models for Glioblastoma Follow-Up MRI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18595v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiating true tumor progression (TP) from treatment-related pseudoprogression (PsP) in glioblastoma remains challenging, especially at early follow-up. We present the first stage-specific, cross-sectional benchmarking of deep learning models for follow-up MRI using the Burdenko GBM Progression cohort (n = 180). We analyze different post-RT scans independently to test whether architecture performance depends on time-point. Eleven representative DL families (CNNs, LSTMs, hybrids, transformers, and selective state-space models) were trained under a unified, QC-driven pipeline with patient-level cross-validation. Across both stages, accuracies were comparable (~0.70-0.74), but discrimination improved at the second follow-up, with F1 and AUC increasing for several models, indicating richer separability later in the care pathway. A Mamba+CNN hybrid consistently offered the best accuracy-efficiency trade-off, while transformer variants delivered competitive AUCs at substantially higher computational cost and lightweight CNNs were efficient but less reliable. Performance also showed sensitivity to batch size, underscoring the need for standardized training protocols. Notably, absolute discrimination remained modest overall, reflecting the intrinsic difficulty of TP vs. PsP and the dataset's size imbalance. These results establish a stage-aware benchmark and motivate future work incorporating longitudinal modeling, multi-sequence MRI, and larger multi-center cohorts.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

In this work, we introduce the forecasting problem from textual time series, where timestamped clinical findings -- extracted via an LLM-assisted annotation pipeline -- serve as the primary input for prediction. We systematically evaluate a diverse suite of models, including fine-tuned decoder-based large language models and encoder-based transformers, on tasks of event occurrence prediction, temporal ordering, and survival analysis. Our experiments reveal that encoder-based models consistently achieve higher F1 scores and superior temporal concordance for short- and long-horizon event forecasting, while fine-tuned masking approaches enhance ranking performance. In contrast, instruction-tuned decoder models demonstrate a relative advantage in survival analysis, especially in early prognosis settings. Our sensitivity analyses further demonstrate the importance of time ordering, which requires clinical time series construction, as compared to text ordering, the format of the text inputs that LLMs are classically trained on. This highlights the additional benefit that can be ascertained from time-ordered corpora, with implications for temporal tasks in the era of widespread LLM use.</p></details> | <details><summary>AAAI ...</summary><p>AAAI AI for Social Impact 2026.

From ResNet for visual recognition to Transformer for vision-language alignment, the AI models have achieved superior capability to humans. Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift. For all scenarios, we also rigorously investigate trustworthiness via three aspects: (1) Robustness, (2) Explainability, and (3) Adaptability. Based on these dimensions, we propose effective solutions and fundamental insights, meanwhile aiming to enhance the critical ML problems, such as efficiency, adaptability, and safety.</p></details> | PhD Thesis |

Existing configuration-based or intent-driven Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches usually rely on static mappings and SLA conversions. The current literature does not integrate natural language understanding with coordinated decision-making. To address these limitations, we propose an Agentic AI framework for 6G RAN slicing, driven by a super agent built using Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM) controllers and a Large Language Model (LLM). The super agent interprets operator intents and translates them into actionable goals using the LLM, which are used by HDM to coordinate inter-slice, intra-slice, and self-healing agents. Compared to transformer-based and reward-driven baselines, the proposed Agentic AI framework demonstrates consistent improvements across key performance indicators, including higher throughput, improved cell-edge performance, and reduced latency across different slices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript under review in IEEE Networking Letters.

However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level, easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving $1.07\times-2.43\times$ speedup in end-to-end training throughput.</p></details> | <details><summary>GitHu...</summary><p>GitHub Repo: https://github.com/RLinf/RLinf</p></details> |

HY-Motion 1.0 represents the first successful attempt to scale up Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based flow matching models to the billion-parameter scale within the motion generation domain, delivering instruction-following capabilities that significantly outperform current open-source benchmarks. Uniquely, we introduce a comprehensive, full-stage training paradigm -- including large-scale pretraining on over 3,000 hours of motion data, high-quality fine-tuning on 400 hours of curated data, and reinforcement learning from both human feedback and reward models -- to ensure precise alignment with the text instruction and high motion quality. This framework is supported by our meticulous data processing pipeline, which performs rigorous motion cleaning and captioning. Consequently, our model achieves the most extensive coverage, spanning over 200 motion categories across 6 major classes. We release HY-Motion 1.0 to the open-source community to foster future research and accelerate the transition of 3D human motion generation models towards commercial maturity.</p></details> | <details><summary>Githu...</summary><p>Github: see https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/HY-Motion-1.0</p></details> |

Current approaches to driving scene synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction. Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through multimodal conditional control.

This paper presents a mobile-efficient SER system based on DistilHuBERT, a distilled and 8-bit quantized transformer that achieves 92% parameter reduction compared to full-scale Wav2Vec 2.0 models while maintaining competitive accuracy. We conduct a rigorous 5-fold Leave-One-Session-Out (LOSO) cross-validation on the IEMOCAP dataset to ensure speaker independence, augmented with cross-corpus training on CREMA-D to enhance generalization. Cross-corpus training with CREMA-D yields a 1.2% improvement in Weighted Accuracy, a 1.4% gain in Macro F1-score, and a 32% reduction in cross-fold variance, with the Neutral class showing the most substantial benefit at 5.4% F1-score improvement. Our approach achieves an Unweighted Accuracy of 61.4% with a quantized model footprint of only 23 MB, representing approximately 91% of full-scale baseline performance. Cross-corpus evaluation on RAVDESS reveals that the theatrical nature of acted emotions causes predictions to cluster by arousal level rather than valence: happiness is systematically confused with anger due to acoustic saturation in high-energy expressions. Despite this theatricality effect reducing overall RAVDESS accuracy to 43.29%, the model maintains robust arousal detection with 97% recall for anger and 64% for sadness. These findings establish a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between model size and accuracy, enabling practical affect recognition on resource-constrained mobile devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 2 tables, 1 figure.

This redundancy is not required for representation, but is strictly necessary to solve the non-convex optimization search problem-finding a global minimum, which remains intractable for compact networks. In this work, we propose a constructive approach to bypass this optimization bottleneck. By decoupling the solution geometry from the ambient search space, we empirically demonstrate across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that the classification head can be compressed by even huge factors of 16 with negligible performance degradation. This motivates Subspace-Native Distillation as a novel paradigm: by defining the target directly in this constructed subspace, we provide a stable geometric coordinate system for student models, potentially allowing them to circumvent the high-dimensional search problem entirely and realize the vision of Train Big, Deploy Small.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at https://github.com/yuskal/Directly-Constructing-Low-Dimensional-Solution-Subspaces-in-Deep-Neural-Networks</p></details> |

Existing dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting methods couple reconstruction with optimization-dependent compression and customized motion formats, limiting generalization and standardization. To address this, we propose D-FCGS, a novel Feedforward Compression framework for Dynamic Gaussian Splatting. Key innovations include: (1) a standardized Group-of-Frames (GoF) structure with I-P coding, leveraging sparse control points to extract inter-frame motion tensors; (2) a dual prior-aware entropy model that fuses hyperprior and spatial-temporal priors for accurate rate estimation; (3) a control-point-guided motion compensation mechanism and refinement network to enhance view-consistent fidelity. Trained on Gaussian frames derived from multi-view videos, D-FCGS generalizes across diverse scenes in a zero-shot fashion. Experiments show that it matches the rate-distortion performance of optimization-based methods, achieving over 17 times compression compared to the baseline while preserving visual quality across viewpoints. This work advances feedforward compression of dynamic 3DGS, facilitating scalable FVV transmission and storage for immersive applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>code:...</summary><p>code:https://github.com/Mr-Zwkid/D-FCGS</p></details> |

However, the coexistence of diverse SSI ecosystems, such as the European Digital Identity and the European Blockchain Services Infrastructure, poses significant challenges for cross-ecosystem interoperability due to technological and trust framework differences. This paper introduces \textit{interID}, a modular credential verification application that addresses this fragmentation by orchestrating ecosystem-specific verifier services. Our key contributions include: (1) an ecosystem-agnostic orchestration layer that interfaces with multiple SSI verification services, (2) a unified API that abstracts underlying protocol complexities for service providers, and (3) a practical implementation that bridges three major SSI ecosystems: Hyperledger Indy/Aries, EBSI, and EUDI. Evaluation results demonstrate that interID successfully verifies credentials across all tested wallets with minimal performance overhead, while maintaining a flexible architecture that can be extended to accept credentials from additional SSI ecosystems. This work offers both a technical solution and architectural pattern for achieving interoperability in SSI verifier implementations.</p></details> | IEEE Explore 2025 |
| **[A unified framework for detecting point and collective anomalies in operating system logs via collaborative transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23380v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Log anomaly detection is crucial for preserving the security of operating systems. Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses. We also provide the implementation of CoLog at https://github.com/NasirzadehMoh/CoLog.</p></details> | <details><summary>72 pa...</summary><p>72 pages, 19 figures, 19 tables, accepted in scientific reports on 5 November 2025</p></details> |

In this work, we explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat spikes using RGB images and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth references. Wheat spike volume is promising for phenotyping as it shows high correlation with spike dry weight, a key component of fruiting efficiency. Accounting for the complex geometry of the spikes, we compare different neural network approaches for volume estimation from 2D images and benchmark them against two conventional baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using axis-aligned cross-sections. Fine-tuned Vision Transformers (DINOv2 and DINOv3) with MLPs achieve the lowest MAPE of 5.08\% and 4.67\% and the highest correlation of 0.96 and 0.97 on six-view indoor images, outperforming fine-tuned CNNs (ResNet18 and ResNet50), wheat-specific backbones, and both baselines. When using frozen DINO backbones, deep-supervised LSTMs outperform MLPs, whereas after fine-tuning, improved high-level representations allow simple MLPs to outperform LSTMs. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume estimation accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing greater challenges for geometric methods than for deep learning approaches. Fine-tuning DINOv3 on field-based single side-view images yields a MAPE of 8.39\% and a correlation of 0.90, providing a novel pipeline and a fast, accurate, and non-destructive approach for wheat spike volume phenotyping.</p></details> | 18 pages, 22 figures |
| **[ReSemAct: Advancing Fine-Grained Robotic Manipulation via Semantic Structuring and Affordance Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18262v4)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fine-grained robotic manipulation requires grounding natural language into appropriate affordance targets. However, most existing methods driven by foundation models often compress rich semantics into oversimplified affordances, preventing exploitation of implicit semantic information. To address these challenges, we present ReSemAct, a novel unified manipulation framework that introduces Semantic Structuring and Affordance Refinement (SSAR), powered by the automated synergistic reasoning between Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs). Specifically, the Semantic Structuring module derives a unified semantic affordance description from natural language and RGB observations, organizing affordance regions, implicit functional intent, and coarse affordance anchors into a structured representation for downstream refinement. Building upon this specification, the Affordance Refinement strategy instantiates two complementary flows that separately specialize geometry and position, yielding fine-grained affordance targets. These refined targets are then encoded as real-time joint-space optimization objectives, enabling reactive and robust manipulation in dynamic environments.

| **[Splitwise: Collaborative Edge-Cloud Inference for LLMs via Lyapunov-Assisted DRL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23310v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying large language models (LLMs) on edge devices is challenging due to their limited memory and power resources. Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures.

This study presents a critical comparison between two fundamentally different AI architectures: the specialized open-source agent MedGemma and the proprietary large multimodal model GPT-4 for diagnosing six different diseases. The MedGemma-4b-it model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), demonstrated superior diagnostic capability by achieving a mean test accuracy of 80.37% compared to 69.58% for the untuned GPT-4. Furthermore, MedGemma exhibited notably higher sensitivity in high-stakes clinical tasks, such as cancer and pneumonia detection. Quantitative analysis via confusion matrices and classification reports provides comprehensive insights into model performance across all categories. These results emphasize that domain-specific fine-tuning is essential for minimizing hallucinations in clinical implementation, positioning MedGemma as a sophisticated tool for complex, evidence-based medical reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Journal of Machine Learning and Deep Learning (JMLDL). 9 pages, 9 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |
| **[Age-Defying Face Recognition with Transformer-Enhanced Loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02198v4)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aging presents a significant challenge in face recognition, as changes in skin texture and tone can alter facial features over time, making it particularly difficult to compare images of the same individual taken years apart, such as in long-term identification scenarios. Transformer networks have the strength to preserve sequential spatial relationships caused by aging effect. This paper presents a technique for loss evaluation that uses a transformer network as an additive loss in the face recognition domain. The standard metric loss function typically takes the final embedding of the main CNN backbone as its input. Here, we employ a transformer-metric loss, a combined approach that integrates both transformer-loss and metric-loss. This research intends to analyze the transformer behavior on the convolution output when the CNN outcome is arranged in a sequential vector. These sequential vectors have the potential to overcome the texture or regional structure referred to as wrinkles or sagging skin affected by aging. The transformer encoder takes input from the contextual vectors obtained from the final convolution layer of the network. The learned features can be more age-invariant, complementing the discriminative power of the standard metric loss embedding. With this technique, we use transformer loss with various base metric-loss functions to evaluate the effect of the combined loss functions. We observe that such a configuration allows the network to achieve SoTA results in LFW and age-variant datasets (CA-LFW and AgeDB). This research expands the role of transformers in the machine vision domain and opens new possibilities for exploring transformers as a loss function.</p></details> | <details><summary>Face ...</summary><p>Face Recognition for Age-variant Datasets</p></details> |

However, existing methods often oversimplify the anomaly space by treating all abnormal events as a single category, overlooking the diverse semantic and temporal characteristics intrinsic to real-world anomalies. Inspired by how humans perceive anomalies, by jointly interpreting temporal motion patterns and semantic structures underlying different anomaly types, we propose RefineVAD, a novel framework that mimics this dual-process reasoning. Our framework integrates two core modules. The first, Motion-aware Temporal Attention and Recalibration (MoTAR), estimates motion salience and dynamically adjusts temporal focus via shift-based attention and global Transformer-based modeling. The second, Category-Oriented Refinement (CORE), injects soft anomaly category priors into the representation space by aligning segment-level features with learnable category prototypes through cross-attention. By jointly leveraging temporal dynamics and semantic structure, explicitly models both "how" motion evolves and "what" semantic category it resembles. Extensive experiments on WVAD benchmark validate the effectiveness of RefineVAD and highlight the importance of integrating semantic context to guide feature refinement toward anomaly-relevant patterns.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Generally, such problems are solved by optimizing reporting odds ratio (ROR) or proportional reporting ratio (PRR). However, these methods that rely on statistical methods cannot eliminate the biased data, leading to inaccurate signal prediction. In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer. The former identifies the biased data according to the Euclidean distance and generates a clean dataset by deleting the biased data. The latter is an ADR prediction model based on Transformer trained on the clean data set. The results show that the ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than those of the traditional methods. Furthermore, the accuracy rate, F1 score, recall rate and AUC of PFed-Signal are 0.887, 0.890, 0.913 and 0.957 respectively, which are higher than the baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine</p></details> |

Despite substantial progress in related domains such as music-driven 3D dance generation, pose-driven image animation, and audio-driven talking-head synthesis, existing methods cannot be directly adapted to this task. Moreover, the limited studies in this area still struggle to jointly achieve high-quality visual appearance and realistic human motion. Accordingly, we present MACE-Dance, a music-driven dance video generation framework with cascaded Mixture-of-Experts (MoE). The Motion Expert performs music-to-3D motion generation while enforcing kinematic plausibility and artistic expressiveness, whereas the Appearance Expert carries out motion- and reference-conditioned video synthesis, preserving visual identity with spatiotemporal coherence. Specifically, the Motion Expert adopts a diffusion model with a BiMamba-Transformer hybrid architecture and a Guidance-Free Training (GFT) strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in 3D dance generation. The Appearance Expert employs a decoupled kinematic-aesthetic fine-tuning strategy, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in pose-driven image animation. To better benchmark this task, we curate a large-scale and diverse dataset and design a motion-appearance evaluation protocol. Based on this protocol, MACE-Dance also achieves state-of-the-art performance.

| **[Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066v4)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 52 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/TeleAI-AI-Flow/InformationCapacity.

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models. In experiments, the proposed methods improved the performance of the vanilla DETR and the more recently developed Co-DETR by 3.6 percent points (pp) and 1.1 pp, respectively, in terms of average precision (AP).</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

We hypothesize that these errors stem from the flexibility of general-purpose languages, which permits multiple valid approaches and requires implicit state management. To test this hypothesis, we introduce Anka, a domain-specific language (DSL) for data transformation pipelines designed with explicit, constrained syntax that reduces ambiguity in code generation. Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training. We release the complete language implementation, benchmark suite, and evaluation framework to facilitate further research.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables.

Existing efficient architectures often employ feature dimensionality reduction strategies, which inadvertently induces Geometric Aliasing, resulting in the loss of critical physical boundary information. To address this, we propose the Physics-Geometry Operator Transformer (PGOT), designed to reconstruct physical feature learning through explicit geometry awareness. Specifically, we propose Spectrum-Preserving Geometric Attention (SpecGeo-Attention). Utilizing a ``physics slicing-geometry injection" mechanism, this module incorporates multi-scale geometric encodings to explicitly preserve multi-scale geometric features while maintaining linear computational complexity $O(N)$. Furthermore, PGOT dynamically routes computations to low-order linear paths for smooth regions and high-order non-linear paths for shock waves and discontinuities based on spatial coordinates, enabling spatially adaptive and high-precision physical field modeling. PGOT achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across four standard benchmarks and excels in large-scale industrial tasks including airfoil and car designs.</p></details> | 22 pages, 17 figures |

In this work, we present LogosQ, a high performance backend agnostic quantum computing library implemented in Rust that enforces correctness through compile time type safety. Unlike existing tools, LogosQ leverages Rust static analysis to eliminate entire classes of runtime errors, particularly in parameter-shift rule gradient computations for variational algorithms. We introduce novel optimization techniques, including direct state-vector manipulation, adaptive parallel processing, and an FFT optimized Quantum Fourier Transform, which collectively deliver speedups of up to 900 times for state preparation (QFT) and 2 to 5 times for variational workloads over Python frameworks (PennyLane, Qiskit), 6 to 22 times over Julia implementations (Yao), and competitive performance with Q sharp. Beyond performance, we validate numerical stability through variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) experiments on molecular hydrogen and XYZ Heisenberg models, achieving chemical accuracy even in edge cases where other libraries fail. By combining the safety of systems programming with advanced circuit optimization, LogosQ establishes a new standard for reliable and efficient quantum simulation.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/zazabap/LogosQ https://github.com/zazabap/LogosQBenchmarks https://crates.io/crates/logosq https://logosqbook.vercel.app/</p></details> |

While accurate prediction of their physicochemical properties is essential for accelerating peptide development, existing molecular language models rely on representations that fail to capture this complexity. Atom-level SMILES notation generates long token sequences and obscures cyclic topology, whereas amino-acid-level representations cannot encode the diverse chemical modifications central to modern peptide design. To bridge this representational gap, the Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules (HELM) offers a unified framework enabling precise description of both monomer composition and connectivity, making it a promising foundation for peptide language modeling. Here, we propose HELM-BERT, the first encoder-based peptide language model trained on HELM notation. Based on DeBERTa, HELM-BERT is specifically designed to capture hierarchical dependencies within HELM sequences. The model is pre-trained on a curated corpus of 39,079 chemically diverse peptides spanning linear and cyclic structures. HELM-BERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based language models in downstream tasks, including cyclic peptide membrane permeability prediction and peptide-protein interaction prediction. These results demonstrate that HELM's explicit monomer- and topology-aware representations offer substantial data-efficiency advantages for modeling therapeutic peptides, bridging a long-standing gap between small-molecule and protein language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages; includes Supplementary Information</p></details> |

However, their trustworthiness remains a significant concern, as they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks aimed at eliciting inappropriate or harmful responses. However, existing jailbreak attacks mainly operate at the natural language level and rely on a single attack strategy, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensively assessing LLM robustness. In this paper, we propose Equacode, a novel multi-strategy jailbreak approach for large language models via equation-solving and code completion. This approach transforms malicious intent into a mathematical problem and then requires the LLM to solve it using code, leveraging the complexity of cross-domain tasks to divert the model's focus toward task completion rather than safety constraints. Experimental results show that Equacode achieves an average success rate of 91.19% on the GPT series and 98.65% across 3 state-of-the-art LLMs, all with only a single query. Further, ablation experiments demonstrate that EquaCode outperforms either the mathematical equation module or the code module alone. This suggests a strong synergistic effect, thereby demonstrating that multi-strategy approach yields results greater than the sum of its parts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a preprint.

Existing approaches introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics, applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX) significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |

To mitigate overfitting to restoration behaviors when conditioned on 3DGS renderings, ReCamDriving adopts a two-stage training paradigm: the first stage uses camera poses for coarse control, while the second stage incorporates 3DGS renderings for fine-grained viewpoint and geometric guidance. Furthermore, we present a 3DGS-based cross-trajectory data curation strategy to eliminate the train-test gap in camera transformation patterns, enabling scalable multi-trajectory supervision from monocular videos. Based on this strategy, we construct the ParaDrive dataset, containing over 110K parallel-trajectory video pairs.

While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.</p></details> | 22 pages, 4 figures |

However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 10 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We propose Stream-DiffVSR, a causally conditioned diffusion framework for efficient online VSR. Operating strictly on past frames, it combines a four-step distilled denoiser for fast inference, an Auto-regressive Temporal Guidance (ARTG) module that injects motion-aligned cues during latent denoising, and a lightweight temporal-aware decoder with a Temporal Processor Module (TPM) that enhances detail and temporal coherence. Stream-DiffVSR processes 720p frames in 0.328 seconds on an RTX4090 GPU and significantly outperforms prior diffusion-based methods. Compared with the online SOTA TMP, it boosts perceptual quality (LPIPS +0.095) while reducing latency by over 130x. Stream-DiffVSR achieves the lowest latency reported for diffusion-based VSR, reducing initial delay from over 4600 seconds to 0.328 seconds, thereby making it the first diffusion VSR method suitable for low-latency online deployment.

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context.

An algorithm designer typically seeks to provide guarantees about their proposed algorithm -- for example, that its running time or space complexity is upper-bounded as a certain function of its input size.

In this paper, we develop a system for helping programmers to perform these types of analyses. We apply our system to a number of NLP algorithms and find that it successfully infers types, dead and redundant code, and parametric runtime and space complexity bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>2021 ...</summary><p>2021 manuscript; accepted by TACL but not revised for publication</p></details> |

Yet inference remains challenging because the likelihood is often intractable. We show that, for a broad class of growing network models, information about model parameters is localized in the network, i.e., the likelihood can be expressed in terms of small subgraphs. We take a Bayesian perspective to inference and develop neural density estimators (NDEs) to approximate the posterior distribution of model parameters using graph neural networks (GNNs) with limited receptive size, i.e., the GNN can only "see" small subgraphs. We characterize nine growing network models in terms of their localization and demonstrate that localization predictions agree with NDEs on simulated data. Even for non-localized models, NDEs can infer high-fidelity posteriors matching model-specific inference methods at a fraction of the cost. Our findings establish information localization as a fundamental property of network growth, theoretically justifying the analysis of local subgraphs embedded in larger, unobserved networks and the use of GNNs with limited receptive field for likelihood-free inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing methods either require temporally resolved high-frequency observations, or rely on geometric arguments that apply only to conservative systems, limiting the range of dynamics they can recover. Here, we present a new framework that reconciles these two perspectives by reformulating inference as a stochastic control problem. Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of incorporating geometric inductive biases into stochastic system identification methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>12+50...</summary><p>12+50 pages, 6 figures; An earlier account of this work has previously appeared in arXiv:2301.08102 and arXiv:2304.00423 ; main methodology remains the same, this version includes additional numerical experiments and theory</p></details> |

For privacy reasons, it is sometimes desired for an ML model to forget part of the data it was trained on. In this paper, we introduce a novel unlearning approach based on Forgetting Neural Networks (FNNs), a neuroscience-inspired architecture that explicitly encodes forgetting through multiplicative decay factors. While FNNs had previously been studied as a theoretical construct, we provide the first concrete implementation and demonstrate their effectiveness for targeted unlearning. We propose several variants with per-neuron forgetting factors, including rank-based assignments guided by activation levels, and evaluate them on MNIST and Fashion-MNIST benchmarks. Our method systematically removes information associated with forget sets while preserving performance on retained data. Membership inference attacks confirm the effectiveness of FNN-based unlearning in erasing information about the training data from the neural network. These results establish FNNs as a promising foundation for efficient and interpretable unlearning.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 Pa...</summary><p>12 Pages, Accepted at ICAART 2026 - 18th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

However, deploying deep learning models on resource-constrained edge devices presents significant challenges due to computational and memory limitations. This research investigates a resource-efficient approach to medical image classification by employing model quantization techniques. Quantization reduces the precision of model parameters and activations, significantly lowering computational overhead and memory requirements without sacrificing classification accuracy. The study focuses on the optimization of quantization-aware training (QAT) and post-training quantization (PTQ) methods tailored for edge devices, analyzing their impact on model performance across medical imaging datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that quantized models achieve substantial reductions in model size and inference latency, enabling real-time processing on edge hardware while maintaining clinically acceptable diagnostic accuracy. This work provides a practical pathway for deploying AI-driven medical diagnostics in remote and resource-limited settings, enhancing the accessibility and scalability of healthcare technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Confe...</summary><p>Conference paper published in ICAMIDA 2025 (IEEE)</p></details> |

Despite their prowess, the intrinsic generative abilities of LLMs may prove insufficient for handling complex tasks which necessitate a combination of task planning and the usage of external tools. In this paper, we first propose a structured framework tailored for LLM-based AI Agents and discuss the crucial capabilities necessary for tackling intricate problems. Within this framework, we design two distinct types of agents (i.e., one-step agent and sequential agent) to execute the inference process. Subsequently, we instantiate the framework using various LLMs and evaluate their Task Planning and Tool Usage (TPTU) abilities on typical tasks. By highlighting key findings and challenges, our goal is to provide a helpful resource for researchers and practitioners to leverage the power of LLMs in their AI applications. Our study emphasizes the substantial potential of these models, while also identifying areas that need more investigation and improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in NeurIPS-2023 Workshop on Foundation Models for Decision Making</p></details> |

Among them, approaches like LoRA aim to strike a balance between efficiency and expressiveness, but often suffer from slow convergence and limited adaptation capacity due to their inherent low-rank constraints. This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence. On 20 benchmarks spanning vision, reasoning, and language understanding, FRoD matches full model fine-tuning in accuracy, while using only 1.72% of trainable parameters under identical training budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 40th Annual AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster -- the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 Newsgroups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.</p></details> | 20 pages, 9 figures |

In this work, we address this challenge by extending Patchwork Kriging into the causal inference framework. Our proposed method partitions the data according to the estimated propensity score and applies Patchwork Kriging to enforce continuity of HTE estimates across adjacent regions. By imposing continuity constraints only along the propensity score dimension, rather than the full covariate space, the proposed approach substantially reduces computational cost while avoiding discontinuities inherent in simple local approximations. The resulting method can be interpreted as a smoothing extension of stratification and provides an efficient approach to HTE estimation. The proposed method is demonstrated through simulation studies and a real data application.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages (main) + 11 pages (supplement)</p></details> |
| **[Time-Varying Multi-Seasonal AR Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18640v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a seasonal AR model with time-varying parameter processes in both the regular and seasonal parameters. The model is parameterized to guarantee stability at every time point and can accommodate multiple seasonal periods. The time evolution is modeled by dynamic shrinkage processes to allow for long periods of essentially constant parameters, periods of rapid change, and abrupt jumps. A Gibbs sampler is developed with a particle Gibbs update step for the AR parameter trajectories. We show that the near-degeneracy of the model, caused by the dynamic shrinkage processes, makes it challenging to estimate the model by particle methods. To address this, a more robust, faster and accurate approximate sampler based on the extended Kalman filter is proposed. The model and the numerical effectiveness of the Gibbs sampler are investigated on simulated data. An application to more than a century of monthly US industrial production data shows interesting clear changes in seasonality over time, particularly during the Great Depression and the recent Covid-19 pandemic.

We present ProtoMBTI, a cognitively aligned framework for MBTI inference that operationalizes prototype theory within an LLM-based pipeline. First, we construct a balanced, quality-controlled corpus via LLM-guided multi-dimensional augmentation (semantic, linguistic, sentiment). Next, we LoRA-fine-tune a lightweight (<=2B) encoder to learn discriminative embeddings and to standardize a bank of personality prototypes. At inference, we retrieve top-k prototypes for a query post and perform a retrieve--reuse--revise--retain cycle: the model aggregates prototype evidence via prompt-based voting, revises when inconsistencies arise, and, upon correct prediction, retains the sample to continually enrich the prototype library. Across Kaggle and Pandora benchmarks, ProtoMBTI improves over baselines on both the four MBTI dichotomies and the full 16-type task, and exhibits robust cross-dataset generalization. Our results indicate that aligning the inference process with psychological prototype reasoning yields gains in accuracy, interpretability, and transfer for text-based personality modeling.</p></details> | <details><summary>The a...</summary><p>The authors have decided to withdraw this version to substantially revise and extend the work</p></details> |

However, recent state-of-the-art self-supervised learning approaches like Masked Autoencoding (MAE), despite their strong representation learning capabilities, lack temporal awareness. In this paper, we propose STAMP (Stochastic Temporal Autoencoder with Masked Pretraining), a Siamese MAE framework that encodes temporal information through a stochastic process by conditioning on the time difference between the 2 input volumes. Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review.

This work investigates whether uncertainty quantification can mitigate such challenges and enhance model generalisability in a domain-agnostic manner. To this end, we (1) curate UncertSAM, a benchmark comprising eight datasets designed to stress-test SAM under challenging segmentation conditions including shadows, transparency, and camouflage; (2) evaluate a suite of lightweight, post-hoc uncertainty estimation methods; and (3) assess a preliminary uncertainty-guided prediction refinement step. Among evaluated approaches, a last-layer Laplace approximation yields uncertainty estimates that correlate well with segmentation errors, indicating a meaningful signal. While refinement benefits are preliminary, our findings underscore the potential of incorporating uncertainty into segmentation models to support robust, domain-agnostic performance.

Releasing intermediate representations such as CSI spectrograms can inadvertently expose sensitive information, including user identity, location, and membership, motivating formal privacy guarantees. In this paper, we study differentially private (DP) feature release for wireless sensing and propose an adaptive privacy budget allocation mechanism tailored to the highly non-uniform structure of CSI time-frequency representations. Our pipeline converts CSI to bounded spectrogram features, applies sensitivity control via clipping, estimates task-relevant importance over the time-frequency plane, and allocates a global privacy budget across spectrogram blocks before injecting calibrated Gaussian noise. Experiments on multi-user activity sensing (WiMANS), multi-person 3D pose estimation (Person-in-WiFi 3D), and respiration monitoring (Resp-CSI) show that adaptive allocation consistently improves the privacy-utility frontier over uniform perturbation under the same privacy budget. Our method yields higher accuracy and lower error while substantially reducing empirical leakage in identity and membership inference attacks.</p></details> | 19pages,4figures |

Existing approaches often compromise visual fidelity by enforcing strictly unidirectional attention mechanisms or reducing model capacity. To address this problem, we introduce \textbf{SoulX-LiveTalk}, a 14B-parameter framework optimized for high-fidelity real-time streaming. Diverging from conventional unidirectional paradigms, we use a \textbf{Self-correcting Bidirectional Distillation} strategy that retains bidirectional attention within video chunks. This design preserves critical spatiotemporal correlations, significantly enhancing motion coherence and visual detail. To ensure stability during infinite generation, we incorporate a \textbf{Multi-step Retrospective Self-Correction Mechanism}, enabling the model to autonomously recover from accumulated errors and preventing collapse. Furthermore, we engineered a full-stack inference acceleration suite incorporating hybrid sequence parallelism, Parallel VAE, and kernel-level optimizations. Extensive evaluations confirm that SoulX-LiveTalk is the first 14B-scale system to achieve a \textbf{sub-second start-up latency (0.87s)} while reaching a real-time throughput of \textbf{32 FPS}, setting a new standard for high-fidelity interactive digital human synthesis.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

When expensive high-dimensional dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative, history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1) coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source implementations in both PyTorch and LAMMPS, enabling large-scale inference and extensibility to diverse particle-based systems.</p></details> | 39 pages, 13 figures |

In this work, we explore multiple approaches for non-destructive volume estimation of wheat spikes using RGB images and structured-light 3D scans as ground truth references. Wheat spike volume is promising for phenotyping as it shows high correlation with spike dry weight, a key component of fruiting efficiency. Accounting for the complex geometry of the spikes, we compare different neural network approaches for volume estimation from 2D images and benchmark them against two conventional baselines: a 2D area-based projection and a geometric reconstruction using axis-aligned cross-sections. Fine-tuned Vision Transformers (DINOv2 and DINOv3) with MLPs achieve the lowest MAPE of 5.08\% and 4.67\% and the highest correlation of 0.96 and 0.97 on six-view indoor images, outperforming fine-tuned CNNs (ResNet18 and ResNet50), wheat-specific backbones, and both baselines. When using frozen DINO backbones, deep-supervised LSTMs outperform MLPs, whereas after fine-tuning, improved high-level representations allow simple MLPs to outperform LSTMs. We demonstrate that object shape significantly impacts volume estimation accuracy, with irregular geometries such as wheat spikes posing greater challenges for geometric methods than for deep learning approaches. Fine-tuning DINOv3 on field-based single side-view images yields a MAPE of 8.39\% and a correlation of 0.90, providing a novel pipeline and a fast, accurate, and non-destructive approach for wheat spike volume phenotyping.</p></details> | 18 pages, 22 figures |

One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=Ω(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks, without requiring a strengthened version of the low-degree conjecture as in \cite{MW23+, DHSS25+}.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This substantially improves the results and simplifies the proofs in an earlier version</p></details> |

| **[Verifying Asynchronous Hyperproperties in Reactive Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23344v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperproperties are system properties that relate multiple execution traces and commonly occur when specifying information-flow and security policies. Logics like HyperLTL utilize explicit quantification over execution traces to express temporal hyperproperties in reactive systems, i.e., hyperproperties that reason about the temporal behavior along infinite executions. An often unwanted side-effect of such logics is that they compare the quantified traces synchronously. This prohibits the logics from expressing properties that compare multiple traces asynchronously, such as Zdancewic and Myers's observational determinism, McLean's non-inference, or stuttering refinement. We study the model-checking problem for a variant of asynchronous HyperLTL (A-HLTL), a temporal logic that can express hyperproperties where multiple traces are compared across timesteps. In addition to quantifying over system traces, A-HLTL features secondary quantification over stutterings of these traces. Consequently, A-HLTL allows for a succinct specification of many widely used asynchronous hyperproperties. Model-checking A-HLTL requires finding suitable stutterings, which, thus far, has been only possible for very restricted fragments or terminating systems. In this paper, we propose a novel game-based approach for the verification of arbitrary $\forall^*\exists^*$ A-HLTL formulas in reactive systems. In our method, we consider the verification as a game played between a verifier and a refuter, who challenge each other by controlling parts of the underlying traces and stutterings. A winning strategy for the verifier then corresponds to concrete witnesses for existentially quantified traces and asynchronous alignments for existentially quantified stutterings. We identify fragments for which our game-based interpretation is complete and thus constitutes a finite-state decision procedure.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

Current approaches typically rely on direct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on log-label pairs. However, this exacerbates the domain discrepancy between general-purpose LLMs and specialized log data, causing overfitting. Furthermore, SFT's imbalanced loss computation often allows lengthy contexts to overwhelm critical, concise details in model answers, leading to hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose R-Log, a novel reasoning-based paradigm that mirrors the structured, step-by-step analytical process of human engineers. This approach enhances generalizability by learning the underlying rules behind conclusions. We further employ Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize the model within a simulated O&M environment, thereby reducing hallucinations by directly rewarding correct outcomes. R-Log is first cold-started on a curated dataset of 2k+ reasoning trajectories, guided by 13 strategies from manual O&M practices, to establish an initial reasoning capability. This ability is then refined via RL using a joint reward function. Empirical evaluations on real-world logs show that R-Log outperforms existing methods across five log analysis tasks, particularly in unseen scenarios (by 228.05%). We also designed R-Log-fast with 5x speedup while keeping 93% of the efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026 (SEIP Track)</p></details> |

Mixture models offer a flexible framework for capturing the underlying heterogeneity and relationships in mixed type datasets. Most current approaches for modelling mixed data either forgo uncertainty quantification and only conduct point estimation, and some use MCMC which incurs a very high computational cost that is not scalable to large datasets. This paper develops a coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm (CAVI) for mixture models on mixed (continuous and categorical) data, which circumvents the high computational cost of MCMC while retaining uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate our approach through simulation studies as well as an applied case study of the NHANES risk factor dataset. We provide theoretical justification for our method, showing that as the sample size $n$ tends to infinity, the variational posterior mean converges locally to the true data-generating parameter value, and that it converges locally to the maximum likelihood estimator at the rate of $O(1/n)$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added Corollaries 3,4,5, and Lemma D.4 in the Appendix/Supplement.

This study proposes an explainability centered workflow that integrates Shapley-value attribution with physics-based obstacle avoidance evaluation for the ROBOTIS OpenManipulator-X. Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates that explainable AI(XAI) techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle aware deployment strategies for learning based IK. The proposed methodology thus contributes a concrete path toward trustworthy, data-driven manipulation that aligns with emerging responsible-AI standards.</p></details> | 27 pages, 16 figures |

Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures.

| **[Multiple Testing of Partial Conjunction Hypotheses for Assessing Replicability Across Dependent Studies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04130v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Replicability is central to scientific progress, and the partial conjunction (PC) hypothesis testing framework provides an objective tool to quantify it across disciplines. Existing PC methods assume independent studies. Yet many modern applications, such as genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with sample overlap, violate this assumption, leading to dependence among study-specific summary statistics. Failure to account for this dependence can drastically inflate type I errors when combining inferences. We propose e-Filter, a powerful procedure grounded on the theory of e-values. It involves a filtering step that retains a set of the most promising PC hypotheses, and a selection step where PC hypotheses from the filtering step are marked as discoveries whenever their e-values exceed a selection threshold. We establish the validity of e-Filter for FWER and FDR control under unknown study dependence. A comprehensive simulation study demonstrates its excellent power gains over competing methods. We apply e-Filter to a GWAS replicability study to identify consistent genetic signals for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). Here, the participating studies exhibit varying levels of sample overlap, rendering existing methods unsuitable for combining inferences. A subsequent pathway enrichment analysis shows that e-Filter replicated signals achieve stronger statistical enrichment on biologically relevant LDL-C pathways than competing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor updates to the paper structure and title</p></details> |
| **[ZeBROD: Zero-Retraining Based Recognition and Object Detection Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04888v3)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Object detection constitutes the primary task within the domain of computer vision. It is utilized in numerous domains. Nonetheless, object detection continues to encounter the issue of catastrophic forgetting. The model must be retrained whenever new products are introduced, utilizing not only the new products dataset but also the entirety of the previous dataset. The outcome is obvious: increasing model training expenses and significant time consumption. In numerous sectors, particularly retail checkout, the frequent introduction of new products presents a great challenge. This study introduces Zero-Retraining Based Recognition and Object Detection (ZeBROD), a methodology designed to address the issue of catastrophic forgetting by integrating YOLO11n for object localization with DeIT and Proxy Anchor Loss for feature extraction and metric learning. For classification, we utilize cosine similarity between the embedding features of the target product and those in the Qdrant vector database. In a case study conducted in a retail store with 140 products, the experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework achieves encouraging accuracy, whether for detecting new or existing products. Furthermore, without retraining, the training duration difference is significant. We achieve almost 3 times the training time efficiency compared to classical object detection approaches. This efficiency escalates as additional new products are added to the product database. The average inference time is 580 ms per image containing multiple products, on an edge device, validating the proposed framework's feasibility for practical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript was first submitted to the AI Open (Elsevier Journal).

| **[Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08066v4)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 52 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/TeleAI-AI-Flow/InformationCapacity.

| **[Nonparametric Treatment Effect Identification in School Choice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03872v5)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies nonparametric identification and estimation of causal effects in centralized school assignment. In many centralized assignment algorithms, students face both lottery-driven variation and regression discontinuity- (RD) driven variation. We characterize the full set of identified atomic treatment effects (aTEs), defined as the conditional average treatment effect between a pair of schools given student characteristics. Atomic treatment effects are the building blocks of more aggregated treatment contrasts, and common approaches to estimating aTE aggregations can mask important heterogeneity. In particular, many aggregations of aTEs put zero weight on aTEs driven by RD variation, and estimators of such aggregations put asymptotically vanishing weight on the RD-driven aTEs. We provide a diagnostic and recommend new aggregation schemes. Lastly, we provide estimators and asymptotic results for inference on these aggregations.</p></details> | <details><summary>to be...</summary><p>to be published in the Journal of Econometrics</p></details> |
| **[LIMO: Low-Power In-Memory-Annealer and Matrix-Multiplication Primitive for Edge Computing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23212v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Combinatorial optimization (CO) underpins applications in science and engineering, ranging from logistics to electronic design automation. A classic example is the NP-complete Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Finding exact solutions for large-scale TSP instances remains computationally intractable; on von Neumann architectures, such solvers are constrained by the memory wall, incurring compute-memory traffic that grows with instance size. Metaheuristics, such as simulated annealing implemented on compute-in-memory (CiM) architectures, offer a way to mitigate the von Neumann bottleneck. This is accomplished by performing in-memory optimization cycles to rapidly find approximate solutions for TSP instances. Yet this approach suffers from degrading solution quality as instance size increases, owing to inefficient state-space exploration. To address this, we present LIMO, a mixed-signal computational macro that implements an in-memory annealing algorithm with reduced search-space complexity. The annealing process is aided by the stochastic switching of spin-transfer-torque magnetic-tunnel-junctions (STT-MTJs) to escape local minima. For large instances, our macro co-design is complemented by a refinement-based divide-and-conquer algorithm amenable to parallel optimization in a spatial architecture. Consequently, our system comprising several LIMO macros achieves superior solution quality and faster time-to-solution on instances up to 85,900 cities compared to prior hardware annealers. The modularity of our annealing peripherals allows the LIMO macro to be reused for other applications, such as vector-matrix multiplications (VMMs). This enables our architecture to support neural network inference. As an illustration, we show image classification and face detection with software-comparable accuracy, while achieving lower latency and energy consumption than baseline CiM architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures; under review</p></details> |
| **[Knot Forcing: Taming Autoregressive Video Diffusion Models for Real-time Infinite Interactive Portrait Animation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21734v2)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time portrait animation is essential for interactive applications such as virtual assistants and live avatars, requiring high visual fidelity, temporal coherence, ultra-low latency, and responsive control from dynamic inputs like reference images and driving signals. While diffusion-based models achieve strong quality, their non-causal nature hinders streaming deployment. Causal autoregressive video generation approaches enable efficient frame-by-frame generation but suffer from error accumulation, motion discontinuities at chunk boundaries, and degraded long-term consistency. In this work, we present a novel streaming framework named Knot Forcing for real-time portrait animation that addresses these challenges through three key designs: (1) a chunk-wise generation strategy with global identity preservation via cached KV states of the reference image and local temporal modeling using sliding window attention; (2) a temporal knot module that overlaps adjacent chunks and propagates spatio-temporal cues via image-to-video conditioning to smooth inter-chunk motion transitions; and (3) A "running ahead" mechanism that dynamically updates the reference frame's temporal coordinate during inference, keeping its semantic context ahead of the current rollout frame to support long-term coherence. Knot Forcing enables high-fidelity, temporally consistent, and interactive portrait animation over infinite sequences, achieving real-time performance with strong visual stability on consumer-grade GPUs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://humanaigc.github.io/knot_forcing_demo_page/</p></details> |
